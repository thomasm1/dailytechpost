Technology's role in this subject evokes the question of today's casual relationship with Truth, exemplified by the \"truth\"-according-to-me approach to interacting with the world. This legacy article's critique of Martin Gurri's 2014 <i>The Revolt of the Public</i> encapsulates Gurri's central themes for the second Guttenberg phenomenon, and the consequences of providing until-then-unassailable-information freely to the general public. In the present case, internet-sourced informational apps provide enough information to supplant faith in traditional media--i.e., the proverbial Fourth Estate.  </p><p class=\"quote\"> That’s what a “crisis of authority” looks like in the real world.<br /> And it’s crucial to distinguish this crisis from what’s often called the “epistemic crisis” or the “post-truth” problem. If Gurri’s right, the issue isn’t just that truth suddenly became less important; it’s that people stopped believing in the institutions charged with communicating the truth. </p> <p>...and what goes up, must come down ...</p><p class=\"quote\">As the internet gave rise to an explosion of information, there was a concurrent spike in political instability. The reason, he surmised, was that governments lost their monopoly on information and with it their ability to control the public conversation.</p><p>So the question must be asked: Is the media still the 4th Estate that adds balance to civic engagement? or rather, has its role turned to a Fifth Column with its own agenda. And, if this is the case, does the splintering of news sources improve matters?",

        "post": "\n<p class=\"firstparagraph quote\">In my last post, all was <span style=\"color:darkred\">revealed</span> with regard to the mechanics of failure surrounding the July 19th CloudStrike disaster, which effectuated perturbations to the entire global community, save for those not inextricably tied to technology</p><p><br /> To briefly recap in a nutshell, Microsoft began to allow 3rd party vendors, like CloudStrike, to use dynamic definition files to update the driver that talks to the kernel, <i>not just in properties (which is dangerous enough), but in programmable driver code</i>, so that the driver is running <strong>differently than when it was originally certified by Microsoft's Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL)<sup>1</sup></strong></i>. Therefore, the worst possible scenario plays out in Kernel mode -- Unsigned code, of unknown provenance, running untrusted P-Code--again, <i>programming</i> code embedded waithin configuration files, unapproved by Windows Hardware Quality Labs.  <br /><br />I think we are all left aghast, scratching our heads. It is what it is, so why do I bring up the subject again? Why raise up the spectre? I feel there are invaluable lessons to be drawn from the incident, so let us take an even closer look at the train-wreck in slow motion, in all its minutiae.  What <i>exactly</i> occurred within the anti-virus program that went wrong? <br /><br />To find out, let us look at the publicly accessible crash dump information, found on every Windows machine; alas, the offending instruction from the logs: <p style=\"color:darkred;\">   <code> |LINE 1|   fffff802 <br />|LINE 2|  1df335a1 458b08        mov    r9d,dword ptr [r8] ds:002b:000000`0000009c=????<br />|LINE 3|\nResetting default scope<br />|LINE 4|\n    BLACKBOXBSD: 1 (!blackboxbsd) <br />|LINE 5|\n  BLACKBOXNTFS: 1 (!blackboxntfs) <br />|LINE 6| \nBLACKBOXPNP: 1 (!blackboxpnp)<br />|LINE 7|\n  BLACKBOXWINLOGON: 1   </code>  <br /> </p> <p> So, without belabouring the point, line 2 reveals an attempt to move data to register 9 from a memory pointer in register 8. Pointer 8 is unintelligable, i.e. it is not a integer, but something else, which then attempts the next in line <span style=\"color:green;\">9c</span>, which then dereferences, <strong>and causes a null pointer exception</strong>.<br /> <br />Of course, a testing team, even a lone tester in a lonely office cubicle, would have caught this simple error, however CrowdStrike did not have that, nor yet did it have a test against null-pointer protection (CloudStrike takes full blame here) <i>nor</i> parameter validation into a kernel function (Windows shares in the blame here). The list of woes begins to pile up from here, implicating teams upon teams and different levels of management on both Windows and CloudStrike sides, so the point is moot. <br /><br />Further details are moot, but is there really a broader lesson to be learned here?  You get what you pay for! To be sure, it is only in retrospect that these lines carry global importance, but when ownership &amp; management are both intent on cutting corners, such safeguards and so-called petty details no longer matter.<br /><br />So, when cost-saving and unrealistic expectations hit the hard facts on the ground --not a reference to the software glitches in the Boeing 737--but to the actual consequences in terms of body count (exceeding 1,000 souls, I believe), the consequences are deadly realistic, and final. Yet there was no such finality with this particular blue-screen glitch; most have moved on and most already forgot all about the CloudStrike disaster ... Are these lessons lost forever? It appears so, and even the once-immortal ghost in the shell is eviscerated from the collective memory of the global community, in spite of the daily spite emanating from Our Daily Tech dot Net! </p>",

        "post": "\n<p class=\"firstparagraph quote\">The Ghosts of the Past have come again to steer my thoughts.  H&eacute;las! I cannot but acquiesce to them. After all, it was a dreary night, about a month ago, in the immediate aftermath--whether canceled flights or muted news stations--of the infamous <i>CloudStrike</i> bug that the misdirected accusations and misplaced assumptions abounded across the land. It was the voice of my ex-girlfriend, with whom I debated, that resoundedly defended Windows, because after all, CloudStrike (CS) <i>isn't a dependency</i>, a simple software. Blame it on the team, she said, blame it on the decision to install the software.. blame it on Delta. They should have chosen a better anti-virus like McAfee! To this notion I inserted my 2 cents that it was indeed a dependency of Windows. So it was both the fault of CS and how much more of Microsoft for allowing it. Further, the users of Windows servers were powerless to prevent the error. To resolve this enigmatic question, the reader and I must dive deep: </p>  <p > What really is the difference between the <span style=\"color:white;background-color:blue;\" >stomach-curling Blue Screen and Linux's black screen of death, or rarer yet, Mac's Pink Screen of demise? Nothing, it just so happens the former happens. And happens alot more frequently. </span> But why you ask? Because of the irascible and increasingly unscrupulous bi-modal architecture of Windows itself.<br /><br /> My story cannot complete itself without touching upon these details --that the strict line between kernel-mode (i.e. external apps, users, etc are forbidden, being relegated to user-mode.) So what takes place in kernel mode? Well those delicate activities and configurations that only Windows will certify with ample testing, like the thread scheduler (bear with this tangent, dear reader), heap manager, and perhaps a graphical functionality, for example, to access driver, which would talk to the GPU across the PCI Bus. So, where does CloudStrike's <i><span style=\"color:green\">FALCON</span></i> fit into this picture? [Returning now to the point of whether or not this antimalware software Falcon is a dependency].<br /><br />Earlier antimalware not only looks at files, but also the behavior of the operating itself; hence the need access the kernel ... thus passing beyond the line of kernel mode -- a necessary evil you say? yes, a necessary risk. However, it used to be that modifcations of the this device driver (i.e. not hardware, just CloudStrike's Falcon software; any software alterations MUST therefore pass any tests, proffered by Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL), which at the end of such battery of tests, is <i>signed &amp; certified by Windows.</i>) Thus, the necessary evil-risk is indeed mitigated; and all remain happy, without any case of the blues. <br /><br /> Sadly, though, times change and standards stoop ever lower -- because it is 2024, and the once-lofty WHQL no longer requires alterations to such drivers as Falcon to pass the battery of tests because of the advent of <i>now-programmable</i> \"dynamic definition files\" (which now re-program the behavior of the driver itself! ...thereby circumventing the once-strict line of defense that guarded the sacred Kernel Mode from harm.<br /><br />And so, my short tangent is completed, now that we know that this dangerous software can enter and exit kernel mode access at will -- The case STILL justifies Windows and CloudStrike because the User/Enterprise is still at fault for using this so-called non-dependency, correct? Wrong. Windows has allowed CloudStrike (in a bid to embed its software into the OS) to mark their driver as a \"Boot-Start Driver\"--id est, a driver for a device that <strong>must</strong> be installed to start the MS Windows Operating System.  Huh?!? Yep. Whereas most boot-start drivers are included in driver packages that are \"in-the-box\" with Windows, Windows automatically installs these boot-start drivers during first boot of the system. If a boot-start driver for a device is not included in a driver package that is \"in-the-box\" with Windows, a user can install an additional vendor-supplied driver package for the device; And in these instances, let's say on a Saturday afternoon when cleaning out the home computer, refreshing, and reinstalling software, these driver packages <i>should</i> be added to the image <u>offline</u> before the image is deployed to a system. Simple. And Safe. Right? <br /> <br />Wrong. CrowdStrike did not want you booting Windows without their precious software! So instead you must reboot Windows in Safe Mode, to remove or uninstall this surreptitious piece of software.  And so, there you have it, in 1,000 words or less, this Spectre of the Past has been exposed, and the public can now act as Judge and Jury to lay all the blame on both Windows lax security policy and CloudStrike's ineptitude to not even test for null-pointer errors (the absolute simplest errors and simplest to test/protect against), while justifying and restoring innocence to the many clients, user or enterprise alike, who were left powerless to the impending doom that CloudStrike Falcon would shrowd the world--if only for a a weekend. So next time there is a Ghost in the Shell, we can learn to undermine and root out the perils that lay beneath!</p>",

Not unlike the dot-com bubble, Virtual/Augmented Reality, quantum-era, and even the short-lived NFT bubbles, the research to demarcate technical boundaries and timelines for sustainable return-on-investment in A.I. remains murky.  And yet, 1.5 years since the arrival of ChatGPT 1.0, the one thing is clear: depth-wise development of the tech is banal (unless you count the hot debates between byte-sized versus multi-word tokenization), it is the breadth-wise implementation, security, and enterprise-ready accuracy of the tool into existing technologies that counts. <br /><br />So what about the unfathomable data-training resources necessary for competitive LLM models? With Meta's July open-sourcing of its mega- 400 billion parameterized model, i.e. Llama 3.1, the world is at the fingers of any typical middle-schooler or A.I. hobbyist to create monumental feats. But not-so-fast say you! Okay, it is true that the computing power needed for this model is a mere 700 Watts of power, which rivals small countries.  Renting of the item is another cost rounding out at $300,000/year... So who can afford to run this model? And worse yet, will the world become even more dependent on cloud-computing?  <br /><br />The time has arrived for developers to fine-tune their apps to quickly access certain problems with a diverse range of LLMs, reserving the big questions for the big models, if only briefly. This architectural pattern, or at least paradigm, already exists -- It was with Quantum technologies that the world was first introduced to short bursts of brilliance (Given that the super-imposed quantum state needed for computation is a matter of seconds still.) So now that we have identified the next big Wall for innovation --electricity and hardware cost--should one fear a downturn in innovation?

IBM's <em>Q Experience</em> was the first to provide large-scale applications for public consumption, but those were test rides around a track while Google here is offering the track, the pit crew and unlimited supply of racing cars to work with and invent with, from under the hood to every tool in the shop. \n    <br /><br />\nFrom the White Paper:\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quote\">\nWe introduce TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ), an open source library for the rapid prototyping of hybrid quantum-classical models for classical or quantum data. This framework offers high-level abstractions for the design and training of both discriminative and generative quantum models under TensorFlow and supports high-performance quantum circuit simulators. We provide an overview of the software architecture and building blocks through several examples and review the theory of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. We illustrate TFQ functionalities via several basic applications including supervised learning for quantum classification, quantum control, and quantum approximate optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can apply TFQ to tackle advanced quantum learning tasks including meta-learning, Hamiltonian learning, and sampling thermal states. We hope this framework provides the necessary tools for the quantum computing and machine learning research communities to explore models of both natural and artificial quantum systems, and ultimately discover new quantum algorithms which could potentially yield a quantum advantage.\n    <sup>3</sup>\n</p> \n   ",

Mr. LaFrazia, a 54-year-old Air Force veteran, recalled spending hours poring over an online list of tariff codes to figure out which applied to his parts. When he called the manufacturers, they often didn’t know where they fell in the government’s taxonomy of tradable goods.

China is constructing a $10 billion research center for quantum applications. The European Union announced in 2016 that it is creating a €1 billion effort on four areas of quantum technology including computing and communication.\n\nMr. Krishna, who also oversees the integration of IBM’s $33 billion acquisition of Red Hat Inc. said he expects the deal—IBM’s largest acquisition to date—to close around June. The company has received approval from the U.S. Department of Justice for the deal, and is now awaiting approval from the European Union.\n<br /><br />\nAsked about restructuring after the acquisition is completed, Mr. Krishna said that it wouldn’t result in any job cuts at Red Hat.\n“This is a value deal, not about cost synergy. They [Red Hat] run on multiple public clouds. It’s got to be preserved,” he said.\nIn the public cloud space, IBM trails rivals Amazon Inc. and Microsoft Corp. IBM ranked fifth in the world for public cloud-infrastructure service in 2017, according to data from Gartner Inc., behind Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba Group Holding Inc. and Google Inc.\n<br /><br />\nBut Mr. Krishna said the acquisition creates a big opportunity for IBM to expand in the so-called hybrid cloud space where customers run some software in their own data centers but also use cloud services.  “I’m not trying to catch up to Amazon and Microsoft,” he said. “They are going down the path of public cloud and we are going to be hybrid. There is so much investment that’s already happening and there is so much data that can’t sit on the public cloud. I believe there is space for all of us,” he said. <sup>1</sup></p>\n  ",

Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous and enigmatic creator, has not been seen online in more than eight years. Evidence has now surfaced that points to a new Satoshi candidate, whose known life has a number of parallels with that of Bitcoin’s inventor. His name is Paul Le Roux and, if proven to be Satoshi, there is a good reason why his 1 million BTC hasn’t moved – the Rhodesian has been in jail since 2012.<sup>1</sup></p>\n",

In fact, there are only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined in total. Once miners have unlocked this many Bitcoins, the planet's supply will essentially be tapped out, unless Bitcoin's protocol is changed to allow for a larger supply.

On one hand, there are detractors of the Bitcoin limitation who that say that miners will be forced away from the block rewards they receive for their work once the Bitcoin supply has reached 21 million in circulation. In this case, these miners may need to rely on transaction fees in order to maintain operations. Bitcoin.com points to an argument that miners will then find the process unaffordable, leading to a reduction in the number of miners, a centralization process of the Bitcoin network, and numerous negative effects on the Bitcoin system. <sup>2</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Yet, in a complex and demanding Tech world, others took the spotlight--as the Bitcoin distributed ledger has been contrasted with Ethereum's complex scripting language, Solidity, which provides multi-variate <i>Smart Contracts</i> that are well-suited for Distributed Apps, <i>DAPPs</i> and generally for financial-clerical-legal documents. However, the once belittled simple, but reliable, distributed blockchain ledger leverages third-party smart contracting:\n  </p>\n \n<p class=\"quote\">\nEthereum has become the most popular blockchain for creating smart contracts. One of the major design goals of the Ethereum platform was to support smart contracts. From the start, this set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin, which was created first and foremost as a digital currency platform.\n<br /><br />\nAs the Bitcoin protocol has evolved, it has gained support for smart contracts. Smart contract functionality is not as programmable and extensible on Bitcoin as it is on Ethereum. However, using features added to Bitcoin through improvement proposals, certain smart contract functionality can be achieved through Bitcoin scripting.\n<br /><br />\nFor Particl, the most important smart contract feature in Bitcoin is the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode, which was introduced by Peter Todd as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 65. The opcode makes it possible to write scripts that prevent funds in a multi-signature wallet from being spent until a certain signature pattern is implemented or a certain amount of time passes.<sup>1</sup></p>\n",

The lawsuit accuses Wright of fraud and theft of “over $11 billion worth of bitcoins and intellectual property from the estate of Dave Kleiman and W&K shortly after Dave’s 2013 death.” Last week the court ordered Wright to disclose bitcoin addresses that belonged to him before December 2013. The Florida Magistrate overseeing the lawsuit, Judge Bruce Reinhart, signed the order and gave Wright a few days to produce the list.\n  <br /><br />\n  Since then a list of addresses that were once filed in an obscure fashion was unsealed and Wright claims to have mined the first 70 bitcoin blocks starting from the Genesis block. After the redacted list was unsealed, the researchers at Wizsec decided to study the addresses and wrote a blog post about the recently disclosed file. Wizsec claims that Wright simply copied and pasted the addresses from the first 70 blocks and asserted the addresses belonged to him without any cryptographic proof.\n<br /><br />\nWizsec says the motion begs the belief that the self-proclaimed inventor acts as if he is “ignorant about the fundamentals of his invention.” “Perhaps Wright thinks that being a bitcoin miner means pointing at bitcoins and yelling ‘Mine,’” the researchers jokingly remarked. In the document, Wright’s filing continues to assert that he did not keep track of which Bitcoin blocks he mined and that he does not know any of the other Bitcoin public addresses. The motion further states that the self-styled Satoshi does not have a complete list of the public addresses that he owned as of any date.<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n",

Rekognition’s accuracy is also hotly disputed, and some experts worry that a case of mistaken identity by armed deputies could have dangerous implications, threatening privacy and people’s lives.<br /><br />\n\nSome police agencies have in recent years run facial-recognition searches against state or FBI databases using systems built by contractors such as Cognitec, IDEMIA and NEC. But the rollout by Amazon has marked perhaps the biggest step in making the controversial face-scanning technology mainstream.

The following October, Avi Loeb, the chair of Harvard’s astronomy department, co-wrote a paper (with a Harvard postdoctoral fellow, Shmuel Bialy) that examined ‘Oumuamua’s “peculiar acceleration” and suggested that the object “may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth’s vicinity by an alien civilization.” Loeb has long been interested in the search for extraterrestrial life, and he recently made further headlines by suggesting that we might communicate with the civilization that sent the probe. “If these beings are peaceful, we could learn a lot from them,” he told Der Spiegel.<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>  ",

So, the label of a Silicon-Valley culture that espouses teamwork can't be blamed: It's the nature of Software Engineers to develop gargantuanly complex programmed products, that dissent and critical thinking have much less place than most jobs.

Several former employees likened the culture to a “cult.”\n<br /><br />\nThis culture has contributed to the company’s well-publicized wave of scandals over the last two years, such as governments spreading misinformation to try to influence elections and the misuse of private user data, according to many people who worked there during this period.

The probe zipped by at upwards of 31,000 miles per hour, about the same speed it was going when it passed Pluto in 2015. But Pluto is 100 times the size of Ultima, which measures just 20 miles long. So New Horizons had days to capture photographs and spectrographic readings of the former planet, but for this smaller cosmic quarry, it only had a matter of minutes. New Horizons' visit was brief, but momentous: The mission's success makes Ultima Thule by far the most distant object ever to be imaged up close.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n <img src=\"https://tmm-nov.s3.amazonaws.com/img/thule.jpg\" class=\"zoom\" />\n  ",
