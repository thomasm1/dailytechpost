  Earth needs Technology as much as Tech needs the Earth
</h6>   
<p class="firstparagraph">Palladium, micrograms of Gold and Silver, and of course, the yttrium, the lanthanum, without forgetting good old terbium, then a dusting of neodymium, a dash of gadolinium and and finally a sprinkle of praseodymium. The ingredients for a typical iphone are not a luxury, but a <i>sine qua non</i> necessity, while the irreplaceable, increasingly difficult-to-mine metal supply <i>reminds us we do have a Mother to heed to</i>.  
</p>
<p>However, Tech's relationship with the Earth is very symbiotic, in that Earth's problems are increasingly dependent on Tech's promise for scalable, innovative solutions beyond Humankind's reach. So, much like the clean-energy infrastructure will depend on fossil fuels to be built, tech hardware will depend on more difficult mining. But to what end? With growing national and corporate competitiveness on a more crowded, more connected globe, the race is on to achieve sustainability with both.   </p>
But the story isn't about Tech here on Earth Day - the story is the Earth's, and why her Superman, Technology, will come down from the sky to save the day ...

The decentralized app (DAPP) developers have no such luxury, except to abide by a certain golden rule; a single rule that sustains crypto-tech's very existence: The Rule of Trust, without which blockchain tech has nothing to offer. 
</p>
<p>The very premise of designing distributed ledger platforms hinges on placing a platform's cryptographic, algorthmic design at the center, the link between every user. <i>This trust, built on mathematical proofs, ensures peer-to-peer transactions in which  <i>neither party needs to trust the counterparty, nor any third-party.</i>We trust in the math that our transaction will be fulfilled.</p>

  Computing Arts and Innovation, Part I:
  <br />Constraints of App Development
</h6>  
<p class="quote">“I think great artists and great engineers are similar, in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicians on the side.” <sup>1</sup><br /> – Steve Jobs</p><br />
<p class="firstparagraph">Words, Sentences, Paragraphs. Variables, Functions, Modules.  With so many languages used for different purposes by different organizations, syntax is more than 4-space indents, variable name-spaces, and other formalities. Today, the variety of coding languages and scripts can appear more complicated than is the case: After all, all computer <i>languages boil down to the same primary tasks: for &amp; while loops, if-then statements, variable declarations, scope considerations, etc ...</i>     
</p>
<p>So what am I getting at? Coding innovation is an art form that surpasses science and knowledge. For example,   coding practices improve with clarity, simplicity, modularity, and so on... but is there an authoritative <i>school of thought</i> on this art? Well, in the Python world, all eyes turn to the Zen of Python, and some say other languages should emulate its philosophy, so let's hear it:</p>
<p class="quote">
<strong>The Zen of Python</strong><br /><br />

Beautiful is better than ugly.<br /><br />

Explicit is better than implicit.<br /> <br />

Simple is better than complex.<br /> <br />

Complex is better than complicated.<br /> <br />

Flat is better than nested.<br /> <br />

Sparse is better than dense.<br /> <br />

Readability counts.<br /> <br />

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br /><br />

Although practicality beats purity.<br /><br />

Errors should never pass silently.<br /><br />

Unless explicitly silenced.<br /><br />

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br /><br />

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br /><br />

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br /><br />

Now is better than never.<br />
<br />
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br /><br />

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br /><br />

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br /><br />

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! <sup>2</sup><br />

<br />
--Pythoneer Tim Peters
</p>
<p>I get it, good coding is more than intuitive art, it's walking the high road without regard for shortcuts. And I can see that <i>in uncharted waters, intuition has to be constrained by sound reason.</i> And who hasn't been burned by artful exploration, fancy coding, and far-fetched architectures? So where does the balance lie? Again we must turn to Steve Jobs on the "intersection of the humanities and science,": </p>
<p class="quote">There are a lot of people innovating, and that's not the main distinction of my career. The reason Apple resonates with people is that there's a deep current of humanity in our innovation. I think great artists and great engineers are simi.ar in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicans on the side. In the seventies computers became a way for people to express their creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great art science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a sculptor." <sup>1</sup><br />--Steve Jobs
<p class="continue">I could not imagine a computing world were it not for the personalization that Apple introduced to the world, to us all. After all, I recall I was first transfixed in 1984, there I was a seven-year-old staring into the bright green letters   of my   Apple IIe ... </p>
<p>So, in this era of the algorithmic wild-west and impending regulations on data privacy, inter-app permissions, coupled with data breaches every week, how might regulations avoid stifling innovation? Steve Jobs didn't have rules as much as Mark Zuckerberg didn't have any rules. So, it's a relief that Zuckerberg, with intimate knowledge of innovation, can set his teams to work with Congress going forward, especially as Facebook conforms to the E.U.'s <i>General Data Privacy Regulations (GDPR) implementation this May.</i> I for one hope that freedom for creative innovation will stay alive, even in the face of   growing bureaucracy in the web.

<h6    class="  chapternumber">April 18, 2018<br />  </h6>   
<h6    class="dailytitle chapternumber">Blockchain Types and Trade-offs
</h6>  

<p class="firstparagraph">Bitcoin's rise to prominence, the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto's identity--i.e., author of <a href="dist/docs/bitcoinWhitePaper.pdf" target="_blank"> the original Bitcoin White Paper</a>, and the platform's reliability (outside of value fluctuations) all add to the mystique of the crypto-currency.  Yet,     new advances and types, i.e. "groupings" of blockchain technology are not necessarily "replacing" their predecessors, but rather filling different blockchain needs; Needs that include speed of transactions, truly public distributed ledgers, safety from forking and DDOS attacks.  Since 2008,   groups of competing platforms follow a timeline, but should not be thought of as a cyclical evolution but rather growing tree branches that form "groups".  Bitcoin, Litecoin are first generation, while Ethereum and Ripple are 2nd generation with crypto-contract capability, and finally Iota and Swirlds' Hedera Hashgraph represent   3rd generation <i>directed-acyclic-graphs (DAG), whose transaction speed actually  increases</i> with number of nodes.
</p>
<p>Each of these groupings shouldn't be seen as making the previous design obselete: They   serve different purposes. Bitcoin can never serve micro-transactions and the micro-economy because it can only handle 6 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum can handle 12 or so. However, micro-transaction industries require TPS in the hundreds of thousands! Only the 3rd gen  crypto-currency architecture   achieves TPS <i>ad infinitum</i> because it's scalability increases with size. The catch? DAG's are necessarily private entities, rather than the original two generations that are by nature public, yet can be privatized. 3rd generation DAGs are the opposite: They are by default private, and cannot truly be distributed without management. Further, <i>Swirlds Hashgraph has patented their source code, which contradicts many principles of blockchain technology</i>, beginning with core tenets  of the original crypto-currency white paper, published in October 2008. For history
's sake, here's a quick view of the Bitcoin paper's abstract:</p>
<p class="quote"><strong>Abstract.</strong> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled byi nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Irrespective of crypto-currency or crypto-contract, there seems to be a different kind of jump from 2nd generation to 3rd generation blockchain, rather than a progression. Research needed to fork into a different direction is because of the need for instantaneous, ordered transactions, which can never be provided by a blockchain design which "syncs" every 5 to 10 minutes. </p>
<p> So, what is this 3rd generation design? Instead of a singular block encapsulated in linked cryptographic, historical ledger blocks, hashgraph uses a "tangle" of one-way (directed-acyclic) network connections. This means that speed increases with the number of nodes, overcoming the Bitcoin micro-transaction problem. <i>In sum, near-instantaneous updates for financial, betting, gaming and social-media data needs are solved by the  third-generation DAG</i>, while longer-term and truly distributed blockchain needs will always be the terrain of first and second generation blockchain technology. So, given that Swirlds' Hedera Hashgraph will be unveiling their platform next month,   blockchain critics and enthusiasts can and should read between the lines, er, I mean-- read  between the nodes ...</p><br />

</h6>  
<p class="firstparagraph">Dictionaries and libraries place the programmer into a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ride the lightning of the open-source community. Volunteers and corporate sponsors take the credit for the enormous effort making a  near limitless selection of functions, dictionaries and modules for languages such as  JavaScript and Python programming.<sup>1</sup> Today, a programmer can   put together JavaScript Components and Modules with less thought about syntactical logic, and more consideration for the problem at hand. 
</p>  
<p class="quote">Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in just one place in the source code. Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts.</br ></br >
--Benjamin C. Pierce</p>
<p>There are a few hundred thousand packages in the JavaScript <i> Node.js package ecosystem</i>, with billions of downloads per month. This unprecedented global collaboration, sharing open-source code into the community, means a more humanized, higher-level programming tasks-- a boon for the many coding-converts joining the tech economy. Such optimism means that problem-solving is fast and flexible, especially in the world of Stack Overflow--another phenomenon of global collaboration.
</p>
<p class="quote">[Abstraction] tries to factor out details from a common pattern so that programmers can work close to the level of human thought, leaving out details which matter in practice, but are immaterial to the problem being solved.</p>

<p class="quote">The effective exploitation of the powers of <i>abstraction</i> must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a   programmer ...<sup>2</sup> <br /><br />
--Edsger W. Dijkstra</p>
<p>These words mean programmers can do what they do best, as much as   what the client-user does best, too: think and problem-solve like a human, rather than a robot. </p>

How the 28-nation European Union's Privacy Regulations affect Facebook, and eventually us

<p class="firstparagraph">E.U.'s Parliament has   invited Zuckerberg to speak with member-states in Brussels to discuss both the upcoming <i>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</i> new rules, along with the 2.7 Europeans, whose data also was sold to Cambridge Analytica.<sup>1</sup> Not exactly an invitation to the Ball...

<p>These are more than talking points, as they are already codified within the GDPR and to implemented next month--compliance with European law will be a mad dash for developers.</p>
<p> This predicament illuminates a smaller world, along with increasing complications of globalization, thanks to tech--for better or worse. Ultimately, Facebook, Google, and other tech giants will need to overhaul their permissioning code to abide by European law, but after last week's Congressional appearence, it's hard not to wonder if pan-industry data privacy adjustments will lead to a new <i>de facto regulation</i>, based on tech culture instead of politicians and legislators ...

</h6>  
<p class="firstparagraph">This week, the Supreme Court   revisits its 1992 decision not requiring state sales taxes for online purchases.<sup>1</sup> Although big-box stores like Amazon, Walmart, etc. <i>do</i> pay state taxes among the 45 states requiring it, small- and medium-sized retailers do not need to collect sales taxes in any state where they do not have physical presence, also known as "nexus." But, beginning this Tuesday, the free ride may come to an  end; this includes small retailers that comprise half of Amazon's 3rd-party online sales.
</p>
<p class="quote">  

A reversal could mean that all online retailers must collect sales tax everywhere. It's an issue that brick-and-mortar retailers insist will provide a level playing field with online competitors, and help to provide state and local governments with the tax revenue they deserve.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p> Livelihoods hang in the balance, so whatever the gavel settles on, let's hope for the best! The Blockbuster-ization of so many brick-and-mortars seems to claim a new victim every month--recently Toys 'R Us  meeting its demise.<sup>3</sup> So, with as many that have disappeared, big and small-, its a curiosity if maybe Tuesday breathes life into the boarded store-fronts across America. I think others share my view that shopping is more than shiny packaging at the doorstep: it's much more the ceremony and gala in the store - a  real shared moment with strangers, acquaintances and loved ones that makes for better packaging, a package embellished with a story.

Bitcoins &amp; Browsers: A Glance at Bitcoin Distributed Mining  
</h6> 
<p class="firstparagraph">For all the clamor about Bitcoin's carbon footprint, who doesn't love the sound of money?  And, for all the pitfalls of Iota and the ever-evolving Ethereum (and ever-present threat of forking), Bitcoin stands true among the crypto-currency platforms. Keeping it Simple,   the very limited, non-crypto-contract may just be Bitcoin's virtue. In a rocky world, <i>a plain, no-frills crypto-currency with stability</i> is incomparable to crypto-contract powers, that are not fully stable, like Ethereum and Iota.  </p>
<p>So, it's living the dream, but must it be so cost-intensive? Maybe, Maybe not, but where does the future lie for all that hardware? Where does the browser fit into this? First, what's going on under the hood: Note this article is older, but accurate in explanation--except for references to Bitcoin's value! </p>  

<p class="quote">New bitcoins are created roughly every 10 minutes in batches of 25 coins, with each coin worth around $730 at current rates. [A typical home-] computer ... is racing thousands of others to unlock and claim the next batch.</p>
<p class="quote">
Let’s start with what it’s not doing.  
Your computer is not blasting through the cavernous depths of the internet in search of digital ore that can be fashioned into bitcoin bullion. There is no ore, and bitcoin mining doesn’t involve extracting or smelting anything. It’s called mining only because the people who do it are the ones who get new bitcoins, and because bitcoin is a finite resource liberated in small amounts over time, like gold, or anything else that is mined. (The size of each batch of coins drops by half roughly every four years, and around 2140, it will be cut to zero, capping the total number of bitcoins in circulation at 21 million.) But the analogy ends there.
</p><p class="quote">
What bitcoin miners actually do could be better described as competitive bookkeeping. Miners build and maintain a gigantic public ledger containing a record of every bitcoin transaction in history. Every time somebody wants to send bitcoins to somebody else, the transfer has to be validated by miners: They check the ledger to make sure the sender isn’t transferring money she doesn’t have. If the transfer checks out, miners add it to the ledger. Finally, to protect that ledger from getting hacked, miners seal it behind layers and layers of computational work—too much for a would-be fraudster to possibly complete.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>So all of this hard work <i>can be distributed</i> across browsers, which improves its energy-expensive plight. I wouldn't recommend running the demo in the article as it may overheat your device--it had my fan running double-time. But the internals are using JavaScript code for the math. Here's a look under the hood, and it's nice to see the role of <i>JavaScript graphics library, called D3JS, (Data Driven Documents)</i> playing a central role. So, below you see the browser accepting the SHA256 Hash along with the Bitcoin Owner's Address, and the JavaScript in the browser passes off calculations to the C++ running the JavaScript V8 engine on your computer. </p>
<img src="./dist/img/miningBlockchainD3.PNG" class="zoom" style="overflow:hidden;width:140%;" />
<p>And so, what does it mean to mine Bitcoins across browsers in a distributed fashion? It is similar to the same concept as Ethereum's direction (or at least idealized by its architect, Vitalik Buterin), in running the Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain across all the browsers that download its GETH software. Nonetheless, here's a succinct explanation of the browser's role,again from Quartz: </p>
<p class="quote">Mining’s ultimate purpose is to prevent people from double-spending bitcoins. But it also solves another problem. It distributes new bitcoins in a relatively fair way—only those people who dedicate some effort to making bitcoin work get to enjoy the coins as they are created.
But because mining is a competitive enterprise, miners have come up with ways to gain an edge. One obvious way is by pooling resources.<br /><br />


Your machine, right now, is actually working as part of a bitcoin mining collective that shares out the computational load. Your computer is not trying to solve the block, at least not immediately. It is chipping away at a cryptographic problem, using the input at the top of the screen and combining it with a nonce, then taking the hash to try to find a solution. Solving that problem is a lot easier than solving the block itself, but doing so gets the pool closer to finding a winning nonce for the block. And the pool pays its members in bitcoins for every one of these easier problems they solve.</p>
<p>In practice, distributed mining pays off quite well if only for the owners of that address. My blogposts on <a href="# <a href="#18-02-28">February 26th  </a> and <a href="#18-02-28">Feb. 28th about blockchain sustainability paint a less rosy picture of tying the currency value to the cost of energy, but multiple solutions and fixes exist to distribute the energy load to laptops on clean renewables, the easy way ... after all, who ever said money had to be so expensive? </a>

</h6> 

  <p class="firstparagraph">  Data privacy regulation's challenge begins with five million apps between Apple and Android stores. Countless vulnerabilities, not to mention different standards and languages across the app world. <i>Like all Tech problems,</i>scalability requires Tech problem-solving--</i>in this case implying artificial intelligence.  About A.I., Mark Zuckerberg remarks:</p>  

  <p class="quote"> There are some really nuanced questions, though, about how to regulate [data] which I think are extremely interesting intellectually. So the biggest one that I’ve been thinking about is this question of: To what extent should companies have a responsibility to use AI tools to kind of self-regulate content?<sup>1</sup>
  </p>

  <p>A.I. help <i>would</i> alleviate the largest scalability problem--in the billions of accounts that Facebook now faces. Yet, the idea of robots mulling over data just somehow doesn't sit right. However such musing goes, the soon-to-be-implemented industry standard in Europe is the <i>E.U. General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR)</i> casts a long shadow: Facebook will need to comply to that regulation for European F.B. consumers. </p>
  <p>Set for May 14th implementation, the standard was frequently mentioned during the April 12 Congressional Hearings. Interestingly, the GDPR takes a <i>direct stand against the concept of algorithm use with data</i> (without express consent), which begs the A.I. question again. </p>

  <p class="quote">The European law gives individuals the right not to be subject to completely automated  decisions which significantly affect them. These decisions could include credit algorithms that use an individual’s data to decide whether a bank should grant him or her a loan.  

      Privacy International said the clause on automated decisions could allow consumers to challenge Facebook practices like political advertising, which can be sent to users based on algorithms, because the ads are meant to sway users’ votes.<sup>2</sup></p>

  <p>I think the E.U. GDPR data policy model is intelligent - who would have thought to re-humanize our personal data   by taking it away from algorithms, without our permission. I like that, after all, who likes to be unknowingly judged? Least of all by a robot!

<h6    class="dailytitle chapternumber">When a Pickpocket is Pickpocketed:<br />Part III. The Path toward Sound Data Privacy Policy

</h6> 

<p class="firstparagraph">Day two of Congressional hearings over Facebook's Data Privacy and Protections  were better articulated than the first day. Important dialogue surrounded primarily   two data privacy topics: First, financial transparency surrounding ads and political ads based on the <i>Honest Ads Act</i>, for which Zuckerberg pledged support<sup>1</sup>. 

</p>

<p>Second, and   more far-reaching, discussion of the <i>Browser Act</i> also was raised by several House members. While responding to the Act's sponsor, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Zuckerberg expressed interest in working together. This bill is not well known, but aims to set prudent, consistent guidelines of privacy in the hands of the consumer. </p>

<p class="quote"> [Blackburn's] new bill targets the full spectrum of the internet, including web giants like Amazon and Google. In Blackburn’s words, it moves the government “to a posture where we have one regulator, one set of rules [and] everybody knows who’s in charge,” she told Recode.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>So, however the power struggle goes, a <i>shared technology lexicon</i> clarifies that shades of meaning make enormous difference, depending on "what" an entity is--whether a technology is a Platform as a Service  versus media outlet or strictly merchant-based. Hopefully, <i>Tech will lead the way</i> without ceding authority in the process: </p>

<p class="quote">

  But the Tennessee lawmaker’s effort hasn’t won any allies among privacy-conscious consumer groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, which doubt Blackburn’s methods. And her bill has already prompted a whole new round of fierce lobbying by tech and telecom giants, which don’t see the need for any new regulation at all.

  </p> 

<p class="quote">

“I think that, in concept, the idea that there should be stronger privacy standards for edge providers and internet service providers is right,” said Neema Singh Guliani, the legislative counsel at the ACLU.</p>

<p class="quote">

But Blackburn, she added, should have gone about it differently. “The way to do it was not ... [through] gutting the FCC’s rules; the way to do it was actively working on a replacement.”<sup>3</sup>

</p>

<p>The bill is similar to the European data privacy model, <i>E.U. General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)</i>, which serves as point of reference.<sup>2</sup> On May 14,   Europeans will   be implementing a pan-internet--edge and ISP--data protections, which include e-mail, Facebook and other apps, equally as for Comcast and Verizon, and industry-wide privacy defaults; Further, opt-in for privacy is more meaningful separate, and  not relegated to the main Terms and Conditions.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Policy regulation in other industries--exemplified by medical <i>HIPAA</i>, financial <i>Fair Credit   Reporting Act</i>--reveals the noticeable absence of similar policy in Tech. Tech's regulation is however necessarily far more complex, involving at minimum trade-offs between app-to-app data portability and new boundaries for different sources and forms of data. Clearly, the browser-based, high-security HTTPS Encryption I mentioned in my <a href="#18-04-06">April 6 three-part series on Progressive Web Apps </a>will undoubtedly be used for quick, inexpensive data privacy compliance, <i>a real boon for JavaScript developers</i>--as if there wasn't enough work already!

<h6    class="dailytitle chapternumber">When a Pickpocket is Pickpocketed:<br />  Part II:  "Semantic Polymorphism", i.e., Double Talk about  Data 

</h6> 

<p class="firstparagraph">Mark Zuckerberg daftly played word-tennis with   Senators in the first day of Congressional Hearings on Facebook Data Privacy issues. Although, in this case, <i>there were two, at times three, tennis balls at play!</i> What I mean is that "Data" and "Personal Data" vaccilated in meaning:  At times, Senators' questions referred to, 1.) personally identifiable data with intimate personal details, full name, location data (sensitive-data); 2.) Other times questions referred to <i>derivative data, i.e. data wrangled, refined, merged with different datasets</i> (composite-data); and,  3.) sometimes the questions meant the harmless, identity-encrypted "ad-data"(anonymized-data); but, usually, Zuckerberg responded to a question about one of these three meanings of "personal data", by responding with a non-abstract fourth: 4.) "Senator, the data, the 'likes' and pictures you share with Facebook, they are your property," Zuckerberg would answer. Well, thank goodness! </p>

<p> My blogpost talks about the shades of meaning: We all know the light-hearted awkwardness when a conversation splits into two separate threads because each party unknowingly follows differing meanings from the same word, or idea.  Austin Powers would have more fun with it, but the Sociologists typically call it  a <i>Semantic Predicament</i>.<sup>1</sup></p> 

<p>In fairness, Mark Zuckerberg volunteered as he himself was not subpoenaed, and therefore this preliminary, public discourse was critical for creating shared meaning and language about a complex topic. By volunteering to engage conversation with Senators, Zuckerberg interrupts the <i>game of telephone</i>; and, Senators engage with their constituents, and lo, America saves two years' of misunderstandings for clear data-protection action now. Bravo, Mark! Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the braver CEOs in American history--Now, he has earned his place right next to Andrew Carnegie--and very similar lives, too. And now, with defined boundaries, <i>Tech has a better roadmap</i> for ethical policy and sensible regulation. So let the data debates begin--but this time,with only one   ball at play! </p>

<h6    class="dailytitle chapternumber">When a Pickpocket is Pickpocketed:<br />Part I: Facebook Data Generation and the Deepests Desires of Psychometricians, <i>Without Anonymization</i>   

</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Psychometrics, along with today's biometrics and econometrics, form the 3 primary domains of statistical research. These three fields approach research differently. Psychometricians are less causally oriented, as their tool, "factor analysis"--<i>analyse factorielle</i>--reduces complex data to dimple, categorical forms in order to reconcile <i>quantitative data</i> with intuitive categories.<sup>1.</sup> And this research is great for expanding knowledge about society. But to what end? Who's to say, after all society is both the subject <i>and</i> object of this research. Social scientists are used to these mental gymnastics, yet are bound by a certain ethos of research: <strong>Anonymization, i.e. encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from datasets</strong>. This is the Social Scientists' <i>Oath</i>--a line of decency. </p>

<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday at noon, the world will tune in to hear Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before the U.S. Congress, all to hear about Facebook &amp; company's line of decency. However indecent any revelations may be, I'm not that entirely threatened by the revelations. Maybe I won't admit I'm   prone to Social Media influence, because I chart my course. Here's more from the esteemed Abbott: </p> 



<p class="quote">“We have ended up believing that social reality is determined in the main by certain general forces, and that these generalities are then specified by combinations of forces, and further limited by various aspects of “individuality,” which in this sense is best understood as idiosyncratic higher order interaction.”<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p>And so, while academic research focuses on the "general forces" to better understand how groups work together, the <strong>bad thing that Zuckerberg did</strong> is not following in the same spirit of generality.<sup>2</sup> They chose to collect and disseminate our "likes" as much as our locations, and ... wait for the ominous music ... the <i><strong>non-FB connected mobile contacts of the Facebook clients' personal cell-phones</strong></i>--flipping through someone's personal desk drawer is definitely pushing the rules of privacy. I addressed this issue in my <a href="#18-03-20">March 20th blog post</a> on Facebook's ethics versus the long-standing data-handling ethics from Academia. Regarding tomorrow's revelations, let's remember to give the guy benefit of the doubt, even if they were handily swindled, while they were swindling us.<sup>3</sup>

On the	Inevitable Demise of   Native Mobile Apps in favor of Progressive Web Apps<br />Part III: The Nuts &amp; Bolts of the App Replacement Process</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Revolutions come and revolutions go, but the <i>2nd app revolution</i> is already underway, albeit quietly.<sup>1</sup> Most media sources refer to a "Native App - Progressive Web App Debate" with emphasis on what the native app can already do--<i>so if it's not broke, don't fix it</i>. However, implications change as the conversation turns to the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Chrome V-8 JavaScript Engine<sup>2</sup>--you know, the web-app on <i>steroids</i>! </p>

<p>So what kind of steroids you ask? Let us say that the power of the modern browser lies in the open-source JavaScript engine, first C++ variation <i>originally </i>introduced in 2008 by Google's Chromium project. Open-source<i>-who?</i> (close your eyes next paragraph for the jargon-wary!) </p>

<p class="quote">A JavaScript engine is a program or an interpreter which executes JavaScript code. A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard interpreter, or just-in-time compiler that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>In plain english, this means that the browser speaks directly to machine code, and this is a big deal. Happily 'roided, the browser now accomodates tasks that the "App" was invented for: <i>To direct service work</i>--image and data loading, caching, storage, offline data, icons, notifica       tions, etc. </p>

<p>Now, through a "Manifest" file provided to the device from the browser, all of those same tasks are accomplished through a series of handshakes, and voil&aacute;: the mobile device doesn't see the difference between a native app and, well ... a <i>progressive app!</i></p>

<p>They say History repeats itself. In our digital lifetime, we have seen <i>record sales</i> surpass digital downloads again (due to streaming); we have seen the originally-decentralized internet return, or at least begin the journey, back to decentralization! And now, we have the once-lowly browser return with a vengeance and strength to replace native apps, with encrypted security, instant loading, and <i>better</i> off-line caching! Do you have an app for that?</p>

  <p class="firstparagraph">Today's Web Browsers, &agrave; la Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc., are <i>unabashedly on steroids</i>. And, well they deserve to be--they were here first! More importantly, the browser's native language--JavaScript--has been granted full power of the entire web's backend, i.e. servers, data, todos. This means that the browser achieves instant loading, <i>fully progressive, device-responsive,</i> full <i>HTTPS</i>-encryption security, and coherent cross-browser compatibility. So that your favorite   apps look and interact the same between the array of browser choices. The Washington Post has been lauded for helping pioneer the technology. Most notably, their progressive web app loads in .9 of a second, while their native mobile app requires 2.9 seconds.<sup>3</sup> Not exactly a photo finish!</p>

  On the	Inevitable Demise of   Native Mobile Apps in favor of Progressive Web Apps<br />Part I:   Mobile Devices Outwit and Outgrow the "Old-School" App</h6>

  <p  ><small>Note on app definitions in this post: Anything downloaded, whether iOS or Android is <i>native mobile app</i>, while progressive web apps are strictly behind the HTTPS protocol, i.e. browser-based.</small></p>

<p class="firstparagraph">Mobile Devices are ever delightful, yet a pesky 2 to 3-second delay often accompanies our everyday tasks using device-native apps. For the impatient, this delay is not tolerable, and even the patient have their urgent moments (or have better things to do).    So, whether we're Verizon, T-Mobile, or pre-pay phones like Sprint's Boost, our experiences are the same: 3-second delays abound--much to our impatience!  </p>

<p >Instant Loading </p>

<p >In contrast, many of our daily web-based tasks are instant, i.e. a second or less. I feel instant loading should be <i>a right</i>, not an occasional convenience. what does this potential mean? This means an app's service workers can load nearly immediately and reliably. This means  non-choppy  animations, smooth scrolling, no matter the network connection you're using, no matter the device!  </p>

<p  >Device-Neutral User Interface</p>



<p  >After a long-day's work using desktop and mobile apps, why should an evening transition to tablet or laptop change our experience? Further, these variations differ between apps--of which there are alot:  2.2 million apps in the iTunes collection and 3 million Android apps, as of 2017<sup>2</sup>. of iOS apps &amp; 3 million. 	 My Fitbit experience is illustrative. First, I admit I have a terrible addiction to statistics, especially bio-statistics. And, Fitbit is my enabler.   However, my post-run tablet Fitbit app experience is different and more limited from the HTTPS-browser experience. App features, options, views, date-ranges vary between devices.  </p>



<p  >Security </p>

<p  >HTTPS-level <i>browser</i> security vs. iTunes &amp; Play Store native app security is akin to a vault door versus building door. I'm sorry, but there's a lot of difference!

<h6   class="dailytitle chapternumber">Heraclite's Delight: Technology Change is the Constant, Human Behavior is Variable:<br />The April 2nd Announced Hedera Hashgraph X Launch Event  </h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Next May 9th, the greatest known threat to traditional blockchain technology will be formally introduced, <i>along with its source code</i>, into our technological world. Hedera Hashgraph represents a blockchain alternative that caters to time-sensitive transactions, and order fairness. Currently, one transaction with Bitcoin takes about 12 minutes to validate. Ethereum is only a couple minutes, but in a world of micro-transactions and micro-second transactions, speed counts.</p><p>Next, Hedera's technology uses a consensus algorithm, which depends on  node neighbors' "voting" elections. This means that the design is impervious to "forking"--when a part of the blockchain splits and no long syncs with the main blockchain.  More importantly, Hedera's consensus design is   built on Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT), so is then impervious to threats of <i>Distributed Denial of Service (DDS) attacks. </i></p>

<p>So, lightning speed for validating crypto-transactions. Guaranteed security from hard- or soft-forking of the blockchain, and DDS-like attacks. Fairness in transaction order. Come May 9th, we'll see just how Hedera's codebase and cryptocurrency will accomplish these benchmarks, and if so, Heraclitean river stops in time! If not, yet another cryptographic mirage!</p>

Ethereum, as a responsible tecchnologyhas redesigned their algorithm from a "Proof of Work" to a much more environmentally friendly "Proof of Stake". Hurray!!</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber"><i>It's not about the Blockchain, the Efficient Network Data Distribution is the Answer!</i>

</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Last week and this week, the out-of-control handgun problem is in the news. This leads one to believe there is a problem with the <i>definition</i> of a gun. As always. Definitions start wars and world wars--after all of last century, did anyone decide who controls the Coal of Sudetenland?? You can bet everyone there speaks two languages, still. The <i>definitional </i> answer makes the answer: This is why Blockchain technology--straddled between myriad start-ups, countless institutions and a hundred brilliant minds is The answer to our scalability problems.   



</p><p>The problem is that data structures grow at differential rates, some exponential, some linear, some slower, some as a function of time or other variable.  Yet, our data analysis needs are clear: We need a new technology to handle quickly, securely and efficiently the <i>Networked, Relational Data Problem</i>, which scales exponentially with traditional data structures, like old-fashioned Excel-like Row-&amp;-Column data structures. Yet, as one would logarithmize the equation to best adapt new data, so must the computer data structure adjust accordingly. </p>

<p>Too rigid, the world turned to relational, non-Structured Query Language (SQL) data, partially for the need to dislate <i>data objects</i> from their tables. The world needed that cell as a free-radical in order to mimic the data structure of societally-networked society.  Alas, a science already at hard work with Cambridge Analytica--again what's that field of study called again, Sociology, right? </p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A.I. Part II: Problems with Scale, Kindly Resolved by A.I.

</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">I mistakenly laid waste to A.I.'s reputation in my last post. It <i>did</i> let us, our whole society, let us down, and maybe the forensics will give us <i>a few excuses</i> down on the road. However, "homicide by A.I. (aka Uber)" will need to be updated in records. But, artificial intelligence is not at fault. There are a few software engineers that did the best they could--with the time their superiors gave them.  Uber leadership, let's hope, will be deterred from future carelessnes to come.   </p>



<p>That diatribe said, I do appreciate an Uber's proximity when I'm stranded at 2:00 am in a bad part of town. Why? Because I don't need to plan ahead -- Uber is there! And, sadly, I don't need to read or study -- Google is there! But wait, don't judge me, I'm not lazy! That being said, I have my own soul-searching to do: TECHNOLOGY AIDS AND ABETS ME AND MY ACTIONS, but it does not run my show> Only I take responsibility for my own actions: I allow technology into my life as a tool, and yet I   hold the power cord. I take responsibility for the tech that follows me--and believe me, I need that tech. And so do you. Not only so, but the world, and the ecological fate of our <i style="color:green">green earth</i>> also depends on tech, A.I. specifically. </p>

<p>

Humankind has already dug an ecological (dare I say 'alkaline') pit deeper than can be dug out of: Flooding, forest fires, and Species Extinctions. A.I. is <i style="color:brown"> is </i>> the only viable hope so we, i.e. Uber, shouldn't prematurely spoil its development. 

</p>

<p class="quote">Several questions raise their ugly head when A.I. can't help Earth or humankind. Like it or not, A.I. will need to 3-D print the dykes for the sunken coastal cities--like tiny island Den Haague, the most beautiful city in the world. Next, A.I. will make irrelevant fossil fuels by 2030, if not before; and those caught polluting would be fined to death, anyway. Without A.I., none of these worthwhile goals are possible. This precarious, difficult and most of all laborious job of designing our own solutions will take time: For this reason, Uber should be shamed even further for their short-cuts, and eventual errors of internal, organizational problems. <i>Uber's experiemental, tax-free "Testing Sandbox" cannot be the erstwhile safe neighborhoods of Surburban Phoenix, without proper caution.</i> </p>		

<p>Are Uber's corporate desires, market stronghold, and shareholders' delight more worthwhile than <i>an entire sensitive field of machine-learning research?</i> No. Uber must be warned to not steal corporate secrets from Waymo, then proceed to be 86'd from California, then brush aside with excuses the <i>killing of an innocent Arizona bicyclist</i>.</p>

<p>

Who can count the number of very feisty taxi-men and -women that are not fans of the infamously hasty culture of Uber. The team of lawyers needed to be 86'd from France? Uber already knows, because maybe they know B.D.O!

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">Hey Uber Driver, Please Slow Down!

</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">A.I. generally, and specifically Uber's Self-Driving Tech, both have failed society this week. Although we could all debate the merits of "Lidar", i.e. laser-based vision, the primary concern, in my view, is Uber's obvious carelessness in rushing their self-driving tech.  Although six thousand (6,000 too many) pedestrians are killed in the U.S. annually, I'd only hope AI wouldn't add to the problem.<sup>2</sup> The Arizona victim was walking her bicycle when struck, and I as bike-commuter can't help but take the affair personally. </p>

<p>This first human death is at least a <strong>big Wake-Up moment</strong> for the industry in its haste to roll out A.I. tech.  After all, Uber's questionable leadership morals<sup>2</sup> and being kicked out of San Francisco for running more than six red-lights raises eyebrows to begin with.<sup>3</sup> My problem with Uber is that the car's algorithm, with perfect Lidar vision, did not flinch or slow down for two seconds as it killed the victim. Humans flinch and humans swerve, because protecting fellow humans is in our DNA, not in A.I.'s. So, while we now know Uber's software hasn't caught up with its A.I.-Lidar hardware--let's hope we see defensive driving and some <i>TLC</i> programmed into those A.I. Algorithms!

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Facebook Fiasco: Why Zuckerberg Should not have Dropped out of Harvard

</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">

Universities, private or public institutions, serve as a beacon for

<strong>the Fearless Protection and Ethical Regulation</strong> of information and data. This is because data and data research

is innate to the university's Mission Statement, whereas business and governmental institutions are relatively new

to the game, and often at odds with the

<i>Academy</i>, and occasionally against each other. </p>

<p class="quote">Threats to student data privacy existed long before the internet. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover infiltrated Berkeley

student groups to counter communism in the 1960s. Around the same time, the CIA manipulated the National Student

Association for intelligence gathering in other anti-communism efforts. But the privacy issue is more acute now

that the amount of student data in cloud-based systems has grown exponentially and is more widely dispersed.

<sup>2</sup>

</p>

<p> The University's expertise over ethically regulated data collection and management, is better than government, business,

and even medical domains for two reasons. First, the institution's long history and ethical motives with data are

unique. The norms of data-handling have been codified through the University's Institutional Review Board based

on its

<strong>stated mission</strong>. In other words, Universities take data seriously

<i>for reasons other than corporate profit or governmental control</i>. An example of personal data precautions has

played out with Harvard's recent data tiffs leading to the Supreme Court, illustrated by a 2016 article: </p>

<p class="quote">Last week undergraduates at Harvard University raised concerns about the institution handing over their data to an

anti-affirmative action group as part of a lawsuit. Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing the university

for allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants, will have access to “academic, extracurricular,

demographic and other information” from all undergrads who applied to Harvard between the fall 2009 and spring 2015,

omitting names and Social Security numbers.

<sup>2</sup>

</p>

<p>The second reason why Universities understand ethical implications for data is that data and more broadly data and

human information

<i>research</i> is the institutions' second highest priority, along with teaching and service. For example, in response

to the unethical Public Health research in

<i>Tuskegee Syphilis experiements</i>, the University instution

<i>stepped in</i> to help design the 1978

<strong>Belmont Principles</strong>. Currently, the University Institutional Review Board incorporates this with the Nuremburg

Code (developed after WWII NAZI research), in handling data research.

</p>

<p>In recent days,

<i>private companies</i> claim expertise for regulating "Fake News", and you guessed it,

<strong>regulation of data privacy &amp; confidentiality.</strong><sup>3</sup> The ethical authority over data privacy norms are nowhere

else than the University campus, case in point Harvard... Let the governments govern and the enterprises enterprise,

and leave the

<i>thoughtful, ethical regulation of data collection and precaution </i> to the Ivory Tower. Corporate and Government

self-regulation is opaque enough!</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A New Politics of Power:

<br /> The Cryptographic Financial Escape Hatch

</h6>

<p>I had originally intended for a post on the very lamentable

<i>Blockbuster-ization</i> and eventual demise of Toys-"R"-Us, but Tech Affairs happen too quickly! Instead ...</p>

<p class="firstparagraph">Today, US inserted itself into a large, deep debate about crypto-legitimacy by imposing new sanctions on Venezuela.

In case you hadn't heard, here's a quick recap:</p>

<p class="quote">The administration’s announcement came a few hours after Mr. Trump signed an executive order barring the use of any

digital currency issued by the Maduro government since Jan. 9. Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country

had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation’s vast petroleum reserves.

<br />

<br />The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation

of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation.

<sup>1</sup>

</p>

<p>

This turn of events, both Maduro et al.'s financial cleverness and Trump's action to de-legitimate the Petro crypto-currency,

are examples of the undefined, near-limitless political uses for Blockchain Tech, both offensively and defensively.

In fact, the ensuing events may be of great interest as we will witness a major first actual use-case of the decentralizing

aims of crypto-technology tool. A tool that softens the financial leverage wielded by centralized authorities, whether

governemntal or private.

</p>

<p>I used the term "de-legitimate" above because there are two processes at work: First, crypto-currencies are

<i>in themselves</i> not legitimate. A

<strong>crypto-currency platform gains legitimacy through a series of both technical and financial trust-building stages</strong>.

So legitimacy is earned first privately, and some currency platforms continue publicly to Initial Coin Offering,

and so on--purely financial and technical legitimacy.

</p>

<p>And then, there is the another kind of legitimacy, which involves political leverage ... </p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come, Part II: A Ripple and an Iota of Sustainable Crypto-Currency

</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Iota and Ripple cryptocurrencies use different technology than traditional blockchain in order to achieve their distributed

ledgers. Traditionally, outside "miners" validate the block's

<i> transaction records</i> as it replicates to the next "block." For example, a transaction is validated 2 or three

times, and since three miners' validations all agree, one is kept and two are destroyed, in a nutshell; one example

of computations (

<strong>and hence coal</strong>) that cost too much time and energy.</p>

<p>Unlike this arrangement, Iota, Ripple, and Hedera use a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) data structure (shaped like

a sideways genealogy tree) that relies on "consensus" from its nearest neighbor transaction nodes.

<sup>1</sup>

</p>

<p>Enough with the jargon! The bottom line is that Bitcoin's tech is not eco-sustainable,

<sup>2</sup> and so alternatives are already closing in on Bitcoin. Iota, the 8th largest cryptocurrency Iota delivers

open-source transparency, lightning speed, and yet is it cryptographically sound? Not according to some tech pundits:

</p>

<p class="quote">You might think that IOTA, a cryptocurrency worth over a billion dollars, and working with organizations like Microsoft,

University College London, Innogy, and Bosch, BNY Mellon, Cisco, and Foxconn (through the Trusted IOT Alliance)

would not have fairly obvious vulnerabilities, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. When we took a look at their

system, we found a serious vulnerability and textbook insecure code.

<br />

<br /> “In 2017, leaving your crypto algorithm vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis is a rookie mistake. It says that

no one of any calibre analyzed their system, and that the odds that their fix makes the system secure is low,” states

Bruce Schneier, renowned security technologist, about IOTA when we shared our attack.

<sup>3</sup>

</p>

<p>And so, with a 1.9 billion market cap, I sometimes have to reflect on the immensity and non-relational fact and figures

of our technological world! Security and other bugs are hard to avoid when an industry is moving too fast for thoroughly

tested betas; and each iteration involves a series of bug-patches, with short- and long-term priorities stretched

with new design &amp; function trade-offs.</p>

<p>

Full life-cycle software development, from napkin-idea to rolling specs, always follows these patterns yet not always with

so much money on the line! Here's a closer look at one critique of Iota:</p>

<p class="quote">

IOTA developers had written their own hash function, it was a huge red flag ... I think it’s important to reiterate that

the IOTA developers do not agree with our characterization of this as an issue of concern. Our report lays out more

details about why we are concerned.

<br />

<br /> There are other red flags — unlike every other program running on your laptop or phone, IOTA uses ternary instead

of binary. Since all computer hardware today uses binary, IOTA converts to ternary in software, which is less efficient

and more complex. This complexity prevents IOTA from benefiting from existing security analysis tools that are designed

to work with binary, and makes the code harder to read and understand.

<br />

<br /> The current IOTA tangle requires a trusted party (the coordinator) for security, suggesting that in its current

form it’s not ready to run as a truly permissionless, decentralized system.

<sup>3</sup>

</p><p>

Optimizing, not sacrificing, should be the name of the game as Tech closes in on Blockchain challenges of security, scalability,

and that evers-so-costly

<strong>Sustainability!</strong>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come

</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Sustainability for the environment means an accelerated transition to renewables. While other nations have undertaken

big steps toward wind and solar - even China's pollution declined in 2014 for the first time

<sup>1</sup>. EU is now 30% renewable--from 12% in 2000 to expected 50% renewable energy by 2030

<sup>2</sup>. Us, it appears, not so much...ouch.</p>

<p>What can we do then, in our lives, to make our own contribution. Well, besides less fossil fuels and red meat, we

can choose our cryptocurrencies more conscientiously. One NY town's recent actions echo my own concerns about the

enormous carbon footprint of "Proof-of-Work" blockchain mining.

</p>

<p class="quote">

The city of Plattsburgh has put a moratorium on cryptocurrency mining to preserve natural resources, the health of its residents

and the city’s “character and direction,” officials said after a public hearing Thursday. For 18 months, the 20,000-resident

city will not consider new applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining. Violators will face fines of up to

$1,000 for each day they defy the moratorium.

<sup>3</sup>

</p>

<p>So, me too - count me out, I can't help but do the same, and pronounce my own refrain from Bitcoin (this is more

spiritual since I don't own, nor mine). In contrast, I'll put Ethereum on hold since they are transitioning to a

zero carbon-footprint by year's end. </p>

<p>And, for the most environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies, I wholly support Ripple (3rd highest valued cryptocurrency)

and also clean

<i>Iota</i> (8th highest valued )

<sup>5</sup>. Ripple, unfortunately, is a private company with a less-accessible internal distributed ledger. And yet,

Hedera Hashgraph heralds the most optimistic news of all: A blindlingly fast Hashgraph structure, unbound from any

carbon footprint.

<p class="firstparagraph">

<strong>Creators in the Digital Age</strong>, especially Musicians, have faced just a panoply of business model challenges,

notably since the 2000s'

<i>Napster Era</i>. And yet, this is the age-old-case of new technologies reshaping long-standing fields, especially

financial structure - the bottom line! All creative fields also have technological features on the horizon that

may, potentially move the playing field. First some recent background: </p>

<p class="quote">

While [Taylor Swift] is certainly making money in retail sales and digital downloads, both of those metrics are spiraling

downward as people migrate away from the concept of owning music at all. Nielsen recently released numbers indicating

substantial drops in both CD and digital-track sales, which are down almost $100 million

<i>year over year</i> from 2014; streaming music continues to grow, but the revenue it generates isn’t close to making

up the difference, yet.

<sup>1</sup>

</p>

<p>Most remember Taylor Swift's 2014 industry-shaking album withdraw in protest to Spotify's payment structure. The

next year Taylor took on Apple iTunes--to which Apple bended to Taylor's Way

<sup>2</sup>. These wins are amazing but not enough, if only for winning battles in a losing war. </p>

<p class="quote">Spotify is the future. Spotify is the enemy. Spotify doesn’t pay enough. Spotify is music’s best bet for revenue

growth. Since it arrived in the United States from Sweden in 2011, Spotify has been cast as both hero and villain

in the music industry’s continuing debate over streaming music. </p>

<p class="quote">

It has been hailed as a potential savior through a two-tiered “freemium” model that would gradually lure listeners away from

piracy. Yet Spotify’s royalty rates have also terrified many artists already worried that each new step in music’s

digital evolution further devalues their work.

<sup>3</sup>

</p>

<p>So the trend looks dire, and yet is it really? Where, just where are the

<strong>Tech Platforms </strong> leading us? Tech is leading us

<i>nowhere</i>, at least not to one

<strong>singular, centralized place</strong>; rather, decentralized tech--including but not limited to blockchain--is busy

rewriting the boundaries between creators and consumers. This Tuesday's Forbes article reported on new subscription-based

model by Patreon. Still classical Web 2.0, it's novelty appears so simple, almost intuitive in potentially new pathway:</p>

<p class="quote">"On Kickstarter and Indiegogo, creators essentially have to start over every time," says Danny Rimer, a partner at

Index Ventures who is a Patreon investor and board member. "It's the same reason software companies went from licensed

software to subscriptions: predictable revenue and better service for customers."

<sup>4</sup>

</p>

<p>

Apparently Patreon, along with last November's

<i>Drip</i> by KickStarter have made headway. Patreon paid out $150 million to its artists in 2017, and each are doubling

annually. Decentralizing again. Well, we say we can't

<i>go back to the way it was</i>, but Tech always seems to lead us back to the way it was!

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber"><i>Tou<strong>Demou</strong> tes<strong> Krates</strong></i>:<br />Strength of the People</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Today's demonstrations and walk-outs, led by America's Youth and followed by many of the education staff, has aimed

directly at Gun-Control legislation. Yet, the message more powerfully articulated than ever by adolescent-turns-adult

students, takes aim at something further afield. </p>

<p>Students, remembering the February 14th massacre victims, take aim at the corruption stemming from the 2010 Supreme

Court "Person-hood" protection for Corporations, also known as the

<i>Citizens United</i> Decision. A dated, but poignant, article from National Public Radio explains:

</p>

<p class="quote">The Supreme Court extended that protection to corporations, and over time also extended some — but not all — of the

rights guaranteed to individuals in the Bill of Rights.

<sup>1</sup>

</p>

<p>

Yet, it appears deceptively harmless for Congressional Law-makers to protect corporations, in the form of

<strong>Gun Manufacturers' Lobbyists, </strong>

as equally as it protects humans. The origin or this ruling dates to a 70's Neo-Liberal, right-leaning legislation and Court

rulings that include a pivotal 1978

<i>First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti</i> decision allowing for corporations' ballot-initiative campaign contributions,

citing the First Amendment.

<sup>2</sup>

</p>

<p>



The Result? The corporation, in "person" form, takes on Pseudo-Human qualities: immortal, beyond-measure capital, and programmatically

serving stock-holders' interests with cut-throat competition at all costs. No match against a sympathetic human,

yet the Corporation is given the same rights and privileges as the man in the street. Now, in the face of two decades'

dead humans--as young as

<i>Sandy Hook Elementary</i>, which were not protected by Legislation, due to commitments made to corporate lobbying.

</p>

<p>It appears increasingly difficult for Marco Rubio to accept money from gun lobbyists

<i>in exchange</i> for executing their legislation demands. As I mentioned in my

<a href="#18-02-14">February 14th post</a> on the topic, it is clear a generation is awakening: And, the Humans have begun to revolt

against the

<strong>Heavily-Armed Lobbying Machines!

<h6 class="chapternumber">March 13, 2018</h6>



<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:

<br /> Part III and Sustainability of Shared, Distributed Ledger Types</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">March 13th, 2018 marks the day that certain types of blockchain technologies, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, face

an existential crisis: Today, a new distributed ledger technology has been announced, which departs from the traditional

"Proof-of-Work" (energy-intensive calculations) Blockchain technologies. This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint.

For example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore's 49.8!</p>

<p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to

<i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking:

Denial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot),

so the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle. </p>

<p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly,

this is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950's (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating

system. </p>

<p>

Next, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of "fairness" because blockchain transactions are

<i>

<strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i> Bitcoin transactions are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle,

which is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p>

<p>

Swirld's unveiled their consensus-based

<strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has now been announced to

deploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news! Tremendous, since I explained

in my

<a href="#18-03-01">March 1st </a> blog post that older blockchain technologies incentivize miners' efforts by directly tying electrical-cost(

(in calculations) to the Bitcoin/hour profit margin. For this reason, the future horizon just considerably shortened

Bitcoin's runway for establishing anything beyond "early-adopter" status. </p>

<p>So, we'll see if the innovating crew with Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum can successfully alter the crypto algorithm

into it's planned carbon-free consensus-based, "proof-of-stake" form. For the moment, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other

electricity-draining "proof-of-work" designs, have their

<strong>exchange value trapped inside their own Carbon Footprint</strong>.

<sup>4</sup> And so, because environmental sustainablity is foremost of concerns for future investment, survival may

depend on digging out of that Carbon Footprint much more quickly!</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:

<br /> Part II and New Forms of Trust</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">

Throughout the centralized-tech period of the

<i>mobile-powered </i> Web 2.0, most Sharing transactions take place on a centralized platform that simply facilitates

the peer-to-peer transactions. However, the trust is based on some third-party authority. For instance, Uber serves

as the centralalized, third-party authority between both consumers (whether resource-obtaining or resource-providing)

must place their trust. Similarly, centralized authorities like Paypal, etc. enable peer-to-peer collaboration.

Yet, the notion of trust remains unsolved: Both parties must place their faith in the third party. By definition,

this problem that undermines the

<i>Sharing Economy</i> is resolved by Blockchain technologies, through cryptography. Now, Decentralized Apps (DAPPS)

provide a truer sharing platform for value transactions.

</p>

<p>In short, neither peer,

<strong>neither consumer needs to be trusted, because both parties share a mutual trust in their shared ledger</strong>

(think of a thick book with an indexed log of each and every transaction, with unchangeable entries etched by cryptography.

In this fashion the forms of Exchange Value include:

<br /> 1. Value Funds &amp; Investments

<br /> 2. Immutable Insurance &amp; Risk Management

<br /> 3. Account for &amp; Audit Commodified Value 4. Authenticate &amp; Attest to Value

<br /> 5. Transfer, Store, Lend Value

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:

<br /> Part I and the Race for Sustainability Solutions</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Sharing can be a philosophy and even an ideology, but it is also

<strong> a concept sewn into the Technology of the Era</strong>. Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer

marketplaces,

<i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer

of resources. By either sense, the

<i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media,

internet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>



<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s

<i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods

and services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>



<p>In

<i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how

the

<strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>.

<sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3) breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general

purpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power,

sources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>



<p>The first condition: New forms of communication to

<i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second

condition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition:

New methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>



<p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving

solar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated,

driverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new

technology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>



<p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s

innovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in

the present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively

the New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>



<p>So, how can we change the way we

<i>think</i> and how we

<i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on

<strong>

<i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i>

</strong>

<sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will

a New Paradigm Shift emerge. In this occasion however, we as a society may not have the luxury of decades to adapt

to New Technologies, as the carbon hangover from the previous Industrial Era imperils the safe arrival of the next!</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">1.4 Million Reasons for More Women in Tech, Part II

<br />

<br /> * Continuation of Women in Tech Theme from

<a href="#18-02-23">Feb. 23rd Blog</a>

</h6>



<p class="quote">This is the first time in human history that we have the ability to see enough about ourselves that we can hope to

actually build social systems that work qualitatively better than the systems we&#39;ve always had.</p>



<p class="quote">--Author unknown</p>



<p class="firstparagraph">My February 23rd Post on women in tech focused on the

<i>workforce demand</i> for more women in tech positions, however today I&#39;m writing on the

<strong>

<i>social need</i> for more female insight within the tech workforce</strong> , given that programming will increasingly

shape our future institutions. This means that every institution, whether private hospitals, non-profit charity

foundations, or government bureaus, will effectively restructure (optimize) their own organizational structure in

an increasingly

<i>data-driven</i> paradigm. From a Sociology of Organizations perspective, the changes to come are breath-taking to

consider.</p>



<p>So why women? Where could I start? Better stated, why is a quintessentially important job sector, a sector in desperate

need for insight, comprised primarily of men?

<sup id="one">1</sup> The facts are evident: ~15-20% of women comprising tech positions.

<sup id="two">2</sup> Numbers aside, I argue there is a quintessential societal need for more women in tech: This is because computing

and understanding data has changed since the data collection from Web 2.0 (mobile), becoming more networked and

relational.</p>



<p>The challenge for society in this age is historic, and women must absolutely be included in the process of the age:

Please consider, that in the 1650&#39;s, the invention of the microscope opened a new world of data and

<i>information</i> about the bacteriological, microscopic surroundings--hitherto blind to all. Likewise, the telescope

has allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>



<p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage)

a universe of knowledge--about

<i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the

data to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the

<i>output</i> can be

<i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the

key challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>



<p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables. This is akin

to finding a needle in an increasingly complex and growing haystack.</p>



<p class="quote">What&#39;s different now and has changed is it&#39;s no longer about taking this data, putting it into a computer

running a calculation and getting a balance sheet answer ...</p>



<p class="quote">What&#39;s important now is what is the context of the data, what is it connected to, what effect is it having on

data around it... It&#39;s basically a network of the data, it&#39;s no longer sort of tabular columns, of rows

of data, it&#39;s

<i>interconnected patterns</i>.

<br /> --Tim Cook</p>



<p>This quote means that as we move away from rule-based, mechanistic data analytics toward more complex, relational

and networked data, we need an equally complex paradigm to keep up. Excluding the female mind from this challenge

is not simply a clumsy, myopic mistake. Worse yet, so long as the Tech Industry remains gender lop-sided, Tech will

increasingly resemble another myopic beast, a cave-dweller named Cyclops.</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">April 23 Implementation of the FCC Net Neutrality Laws:

<br /> The Coming Battle of States&#39; versus Federal Rights</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Net Neutrality Rules, potentially one of the more important set of Individual Rights for us as citizens in the tech

age, will soon undergo the rule changes voted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) this past December.

In a nutshell, the Internet Service Providers (ISP&#39;s), e.g. Comcast, Cox, Verizon are granted the power--as

a Title I &quot;information service&quot;--to slow down traffic, make fast- &amp; slow-lanes. Of course this is

bad news for internet-users because even premium users may experience &quot;throttling&quot; if using the ISP&#39;s

preferred apps. The only stipulation holds that the ISP&#39;s rules are made public. However, 21 states are bringing

lawsuits to fight these changes, and the first assertion of State Law by Washington State today:</p>



<p class="quote">The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback of net neutrality rules, including

an effort from 21 state attorneys general to get a court to block the FCC&#39;s move.</p>



<p class="quote">&quot;This is symbolic politics, because the states know it is illegal to do,&quot; Roslyn Layton, a visiting scholar

at the American Enterprise Institute, told NBC News. &quot;But they can put rules on the book and make it look like

they&#39;re doing something.&quot; The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback

<h6 class="chapternumber">March 5, 2018</h6>



<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel: Part II and the Germs</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Germs present a timely topic for today, given the especially virulent

<strong>Flu Virus strain</strong>. Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era

<sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any

medical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39;

surface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively,

and provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics

are

<i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>



<p class="quote">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating

strains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies

relied on a misleading methodology.</p>



<p class="quote">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations

in the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which

manufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while

it is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains.

<sup>1</sup>

</p>



<p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu

virus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu

<i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with

<i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>



<p class="quote">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses

that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that

are pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic

tree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system

exposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond

<sup>2</sup>.</p>



<p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular

period each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal

time-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>



<p class="quote">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further

away on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses.

<sup>2</sup>

</p>



<p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a

<i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also

provides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain

math can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort

of.</p>



<p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each

other, then conditional upon other factors. This being

<i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e

things: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any

<i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions

about a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>



<p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our

sciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The

first of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of

which gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>



<p>

The third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating

<i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better

handle on the multiple effects of

<sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large

Numbers

<sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new

<strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the

<i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician

out there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Back in 1997, a Pulitzer-Prize winning theory--based on Dr. Jared Diamond&#39;s

<i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies</i> --provided the recipe book for the success of societies.

Not without controversy, the theory posits that geographic and environmental preconditions, once met, provide tech

&amp; resources trading opportunities, within a network of other nation-states also vying for technogical innovation.</p>



<p>A nation&#39;s Technology, in turn, opens the means necessary to expansive, stable, independent sovereignty that

lasts and thrives. Equally so, the nation&#39;s friends, especially those making the best-friends list, share and

receive a secondary, &quot;residual&quot; technological bump over the time-course of the network&#39;s future trading,

i.e. network transactions. So, if our best friends Canada and Mexico are less keen, then there is network reverberation!</p>



<p>Given the advent of a real, lasting Trade-War, I would think that a network theorist wouldn&#39;t be betting on one

particular node within this network. I say this because a disproportionately asymmetrical flow of technology and

resources, while simultaneously raising prices on most staple goods, may spell trouble for the Every-Day person.

So far, Nation-State: 0, People: 0 ... So, who wins with a Trade War? Alas, let&#39;s hope not the resurrection

of the Neo-Multi-National Corporations, born from NAFTA deals, coincidentally, from the late 1990&#39;s. Bah humbug!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Widening Circles of Mobile-App Security Risks</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Security, security, another day another platform risk, or risks from your device, or risks from transactions, Today&#39;s

headline buried beneath a techy jargon provides a glimpse of the rising threat of web-application-based hackery:

Cryptojacking.

<i>Coindesk</i> reports, &quot; Opera browser introduces cryptocurrency miner protection for smartphones ... &quot;</p>



<p class="quote">Cryptocurrency miners can overload smartphones&#39; CPUs, forcing 100 percent usage and potentially causing a phone

to overheat. And the damage can sometimes be permanent. According to a ZDNet article, one trojan generated so much

heat in a phone, its battery became swollen, permanently damaging the phone. While excessive ads were one reason

for the heat generation, the main cause was that the phone&#39;s CPU was hijacked to mine for Monero.

<sup>1</sup>

</p>



<p>The larger issue here is that the lines between trusted mobile-app authorities, i.e., certified by Play Store or

Apple&#39;s is increasingly irrelevent. This is because an increasing number of app-users are ditching device-downloaded

apps, preferring for browser applications--hence, a much more appetizing market for the newest generation of blackhat

hackers, online thieves, peeping-toms, and other ill-wishers. There are a few driving factors for this issue--one

of which is the onset of Decentralized Applications (DAPPs), which use the

<i>browser</i> to interface between the Every-Day blockchain client/merchant/programmer and the actual byte-code of

the blockchain (via WEB).</p>



<p>More importantly, the larger issue is that we live in an age in which the exclusive, native browser language since

1995, i.e. JavaScript. Security issues with browser-based apps were very low, because JavaScript never left the

browser, ever. Until 2009, Data, Servers were the domain of PHP, JAVA, Python, etc. or some other language for the

highly sensitive, dirty work of dipping into all that data sitting ontop of centralized servers around the world.

PHP wasn&#39;t easy, so power and responsibility usually followed with all the extra effort and expertise.</p>



<p>2015 augured in the Node.js server-accessing (can create, read, update, and delete date) new-born capabilities of

JavaScript</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Blockchain Sustainability Issues and The Double-Edged Sword</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">I couldn&#39;t help but revisit the

<strong>Environmental Sustainability</strong> problem I addressed in my February 28th post. This problem, experienced by

the top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the

<i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the

<i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity KiloWatt Hours

per year.

<sup>1</sup> Digiconomist succinctly writes:</p>



<p class="quote">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a

solid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years

this has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of

the currency reached new highs.

<sup>2</sup>

</p>



<p>And, so the issue I&#39;m addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more

equipment, and in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin&#39;s surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year

usage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per year, respectively.

In other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner&#39;s cost (in electricity) compared with the miner&#39;s gain (in

Bitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper Carbon Footprint.</p>





<p class="quote">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin network has

been increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start of November 2017, the Bitcoin

Energy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network to be half of the

current amount. On the first day of November, the estimated consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year.

<sup>1</sup>

</p>



<p>

Carbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner&#39;s electricity costs account for approximately

65% of the profit (Bitcoin units&#39; value, measured when mined). So the

<i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost

of the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the

<i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then

perhaps the other edge looks preferred!

<h5 class="subdailytech">Musing Blockchain</h5>



<p class="author">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>



<h6 class="chapternumber">Feb 10, 2018</h6>



<h6>First Blog Post!</h6>



<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Why are Sociologists now the Key Players in Data Analysis within the Domain of Blockchain Technologies?</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin and other

cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology (peer-to-peer global

ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate, individual needs and uses.

These blockchain &quot;network&quot; analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network changes, node

changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly or not.</p>



<p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships) that

include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain tech must face analytical

challenges that arise from informal practices

<sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role&#39;s protocol for

the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>



<p>Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan&#39;s (1977)

<i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple

<i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time, convenience,

etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm human understanding

<i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of a bank, a person,

or a company&#39;s internal bot?</p>



<p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought the

world the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can not contribute everything, especially relating with social

needs and uses. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the multi-dimensional layers

of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks? Well enough to differentiate qualitative

meaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.</p>



<p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved, integrated

through multiple layers of &quot;middlemen&quot;, such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions, non-governmental,

non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases the middlemen. Suddenly, one

programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team

of hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing.</p>



<p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the life of

the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years&#39; Sociology Network Analysts&#39;

research and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and should not turn to the

Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already at home, safe within the academic

domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology

can either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances, accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises.

Or, the next ten years can follow Sociology&#39;s Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful

future.</p>



<p>Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on

review of the Sociologists&#39; specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships,

within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships.

We Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized

by fixed patterns.</p>



<p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes that characterize

societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large Number Statistical Theory

become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900&#39;s Sociological French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach&#39;s

work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society&#39;s Collective Memory.</p>



<p>No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic&#39;s &quot;irrational

behaviors&quot; and Mathematical &quot;complexity models&quot; do not

<i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate simultaneous

node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups

get jobs), and most importantly the

<i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time and fixed.</p>



<p>Fine. So, why is Sociology&#39;s network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th and

20th centuries&#39; network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era, while North

American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960&#39;s [post-1968], U.S. in the 1990&#39;s[post-1999],

in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of past sociology are inherently small-data and

more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates &quot;human-ness&quot; into the billion rows and

columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>



<p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation

for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of each relationship

(link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is

possible to isolate directional, conditional

<i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation

<sup id="9one">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on social networks.</p>



<p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person

<i>self-selects </i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group&#39;s

behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group&#39;s behavior,

by the group&#39;s influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder&#39;s SIENA software, achieves

the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology. The network graph

can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not

as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes

(social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount

of missing data</p>



<p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear, directed

path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists are called upon,

blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again the same bugs. Sadly, this

semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain for their currency, contract,

and other societal needs--in this case, the blind would indeed lead the blind.</p>

<p class="author">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>



<h6 class="chapternumber">Feb 11, 2018</h6>



<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">How Can We Best Modularize our App Designs in Order to Achieve the Much Vaunted &quot;Separation of Concerns&quot;?</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed Order of

Coders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from structural design.

Hence, in the early 2000&#39;s, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to abide by The scaffolding

of HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we must throw out this antiquated division

of labor within web coding.</p>



<p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules and components

Must hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled html, js, css, it is now requisite

to divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and

<i>

each</i> of these component teams

<strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module&#39;s required html, js, css.</p>



<p>This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and

all coding will necessarily begin to &#39;reinvent the wheel.&#39; This is because any module, any library you go

to, will

<i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate new

css from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual misery, almost

instantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>



<p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher level of abstraction,

leaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice in the modern world, and if

ad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity? If yesterday&#39;s craft was the

hoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part

by part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and

pastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module

definition? That&#39;s absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules.</p>



<p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an age that

each year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic sugar and also fundamental

structure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us

to a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the &quot;Separation of Concerns.&quot; We can allow ourselves

a break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must

<i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s Innocence</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Facebook Scandals

<sup>1</sup> of recent months have demoralized the leadership for a role of misinformation in the Tech Age, however I

charge Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s innocence

<i>not</i> because all of us, as a society, were equally warned. Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created abnormal,

never-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were so efficient at multiplying

and exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social

learning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own control.</p>



<p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial

<sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation were

not entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural changes from

higher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in their content and influence)

begin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes

dominated by the relationships, e.g., the &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;shares&quot;, leading to a statistically natural

propensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel

to the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal

and tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary

<i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>



<p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual &quot;interruptions&quot; that

previously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains:</p>



<p class="quote">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication that the

timespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation Bias, misinformation

and outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that are already hard to change.</p>



<p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,

<i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network phenomonenon--ultimately

driven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry, conditional influences, and

the strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these factors, our social inclinations were

<i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were!</p>



<p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network phenomena

-- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!</p>

<sup>1</sup> of Hippocrates:

<br /> On the 2015 Social Sciences Modification to the AAMC Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT)</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Other than college pre-med students, few know the MCAT exam--the gatekeeper of U.S. &amp; Canadian Medical Schools--underwent

a major modification in 2015.

<sup>2</sup> Much deeper than Biological and Technological updates, major sections were added and/or expanded including

the Social, Pyschological and Biological foundations of

the doctor away? Dr. Jeffrey Borkan, MD, PHD of Brown University&#39;s Warren Alpert Medical School, explains the

evident role of all those unnoticed social interactions involved in obtaining and consuming that apple. Further,

the spatial and economic

<i>availability</i> of that apple also plays a role in keeping the doctor away. Borkan explains:</p>



<p class="quote">It&#39;s time for us to take a leap forward in educating physicians for the health care delivery models of the future&mdash;those

that aim to improve not just the health of the individual patient and their family, but also the community and the

population.

</p>



<p>What, then, specifically, are the mechanisms that a community network&#39;s aggregated health may be inextricably

tied up with

health-promoting information channels -- all this, among the countless perks of a healthy social circle!</p>

<p class="firstparagraph" style="color:green;">Given that a community network&#39;s aggregated health is inextricably, and symmetrically, tied up with

<i>our own</i> individual health, app-developers may design activity- and communication-based apps more responsibly,

and in touch with modern healthcare recommendations. After all, if the Saintly Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s communication-

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">A New Kernel, and the Manifestation of a Two-Hundred Year Problem named

<i>Anomie</i>

</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Given the tragic events at a Florida school over Valentine&#39;s Day, 2018, who can write about Fitbits? So, thoughts

and sympathy for those students today that endured this horror. 19 years after the first-of-its-kind school shooting,

we as an American society have not become &#39;numb&#39; to these events. It hurts as much as it did in 1999.</p>



<p>Darn that innocuous Spring day in 1999, when we heard the most absurd news-- students attacked their own colleagues

at Colombine? In my blog post from January 10, I wrote that American Sociology, along with Qu&eacute;bec, came of

age much later than European Sociology. The past 50 years&#39; social changes and new problems are generally atrributed

for the increasing demand for sociological expertise after 1999, after a singular, senseless tragedy of a school

shooting--this event, like a small kernel of societal desperation for a solution--led to a flurry of self-professed

sociologists &agrave; la Michael Moore&#39;s Colombine, and other social-responsibility themed social consciousness.

So far, only mutually incompatible solutions. The problem, however, is not new, only the manifestation of it.</p>



<p>Suicide rates in 19th century France, disproportionately high, also served as a symptomatic manifestation of the

same problem, called

<i>Anomie.</i>

<sup>1</sup> The term,

<i>Anomie</i>, coined by Emile Durkheim in the late 1800&#39;s, captured the sense of instability, cultural and moral

relativism that undermined a shared sense of meaning. Suicides, week-after-week, month-after-month? In 1897 France,

noone had ever seen it before--at such rates--and people wanted answers. Alas, a kernel of social desperation leading

to inquiry.</p>



<p>People wanted to know why so many in the population responded negatively to the rapid changes, urbanization (Dreadful

factory conditions &agrave; la

<i>Taylorism&#39;s</i> calculated efficiency) new technologies, i.e. electricity, railroads, steam engines; these created

an arbitrarily new world, very suddenly. Suddenly, like trying for the first time a roller-coaster, when all you&#39;ve

ever known has been the carousel. So, we see technology&#39;s role for well or for ill, our job is to understand

how to dial-in the tech specs necessary to keep society smiling on this roller coaster through another, yet not

altogether new, technological thrill-ride.</p>

<a href="#18-02-17"> three-part blog series in my Feb. 17-20 posts</a> on the micro-economic horizon of blockchain technologies.</abbr>

</small>

</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Has anyone else been underwhelmed by the lack of Bitcoin&#39;s daily

<i>presence</i>, despite its everpresence at the dinner tables and caf&eacute;s across America. Sure, it&#39;s more

of a &quot;metropolitan&quot; phenomenon; and sure, it&#39;s become an accepted global platform--along with myriad

other crypto-currencies, but it&#39;s exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies

are useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency&#39;s rise to

fame with last year&#39;s increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its contributions,

uses, fame are one-sidedly

<i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article

<sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of

<i>actual</i> use at the &quot;cash-registers&quot; of society.</p>



<p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological

<i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Rogers&#39;

<i>Diffusion of Innovations</i>

<sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger&#39;s bell curve

ranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However, the blockchain

articles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine usefulness for the

every-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>



<p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is

<i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific information--whether

financial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order before I continue, since we can

all relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most notably concerning Target store credit card

hacks a couple years ago.</p>



<p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions,

this person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction:

they prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that $27, $200,

or $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their

<i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and if the store&#39;s

databases are hacked, then tough-luck!</p>



<p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for each transaction,

providing the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient! Nobody thinks to walk around

with their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit

card system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions

have had to rely on the many layers of security, passwords, pins, mothers&#39; maiden names, etc. Then, based on

the mathematics behind prime numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright

red target on it.</p>



<p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And that, my

friends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency, instead

the crypto-

<i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero&#39;s name

is the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide pinpointed,

<i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for the sake of

renting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don&#39;t need this. They need

to know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire governmental database of information

about you!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Tech on the Regret: Unintended, secondary effects of communication- and activity-based app-designs</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Given that our app-use is inextricably tied up with our own behavior, activity/communication-based app developers

have in the past year accepted (mostly in word) a renewed responsibility. More like resposibility for a multi-faceted

power of influence granted to an industry, suddenly, disproportionately great, and

<i>semi-arbitrarily related</i> to the designer&#39;s intent (and control!). After all, if the Saintly Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s

activity/communication-based app inadvertantly led to novel, and deeply consequential, effects, then anyone could.</p>



<p>After all, who could guess

<i>how</i> these app-design effects would affect the users, years later. Who do we think programmers are, sociologists?

More specifically, who could know

<i>which</i> mundane coding practices, arbitrary app-design--like sharing permissions/features? Sure, everyone deep

down knew their company practices yield unfathomable power of influence over the daily habits of cell-users, a.k.a.

everyone. The easy part is knowing; the hard part is learning how and why certain app-features lead to behavioral

risks.</p>



<p>There could be no better example than the Alcoholic faced with an intervention by a loving family longing for change.

The alcoholic could be forgiven for past misdeeds, but without actual

<i>Acknowledgement</i> of a crisis in direction, which necessitates professional help from social scientists. Therefore,

the recent

<i>acknowledgments</i> signify something deeper--they signify a humility that app-designers are not sociologists, generally

speaking. So, that means hiring sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists for every N

<small>th</small> app-coder and software engineer. History can&#39;t be rewritten, but it can be interpreted and learned

from. The acknowledgment is itself a victory if it induces learning from the raw, social sciences, whose expertise

<i>can</i> predict how or why certain &quot;life&quot;-features, practices, and policies often unfold with undue and

unintended social consequences.</p>



<p>Water under the bridge, but going forward, it is one thing to claim a &quot;renewed sense of remorse&quot;, another

to acknowledge, learn and change. Like last November

<sup>1</sup> when Facebook co-founder Sean Parker confessed certain designs like &quot;social-validation feedback loop&quot;

and other app-design intentions, while ignoring potential secondary effects on society. So, the

<i>Acknowledgment</i> is the big win here--not so much the remorse!</p>

<br /> Seven Nuts &amp; Bolts Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy

to my

<abbr title="this link just goes up 7 paragraphs to Feb. 15th">

<a href="#18-02-15"> February 15th blog post</a>

</abbr> on the micro-economic horizon of blockchain technologies. </small>

</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">7 Ethereum-based technological features offer us a new world -- a decentralized new world, not dependent on the centralized

servers of Instagram, Comcast, T-Mobile, Amazon, etc. With that statement ends general consensus among blockchain

experts, pundits, and authors. However, if the current logistical obstacles provide controversy and competing algorithms

over sustainability, security, and scalability, then they reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses

(and potential effects) than they hide. In my February 15th

<a href="#18-02-15">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects of the

crypto-contract horizon.</p>



<p>

<strong>Prologue</strong>

</p>



<p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the

<i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals? First, a

little background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum blockchain helps distinguish

itself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech, like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based

blockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming features, e.g. &quot;looping&quot;, &quot;recursion&quot;,

with the full power of a

<i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable problem.</p>



<p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the accounting

system of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction, An Ethereum

blockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,

<i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks to calculate

into a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>



<p>Therefore, Ethereum&#39;s Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum

blockchain is actually a &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, like a a big networked &quot;home computer&quot;. The native

language of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an

<i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home computer,

then directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman&#39;s terms, the manner that modern-day app,

for example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one programming system

to interact with another, such as Instragram offers a &quot;sharing API&quot; that connects to hardware contacts,

thus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook

account, via your T-Mobile phone&#39;s contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we

live in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system,

which exchanges API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier.</p>



<p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity

days; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise. The reason

being that digital math uses binary &quot;on/off&quot; calculations, while quantum math implicates a tertiary,

<i>qubit</i> &quot;simultaneous states&quot;. Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology,

both programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA&#39;s blockchain

design utilizes a

<i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one&#39;s transaction is entered into with a private-key, and the blockchain

moreso resembles a &quot;Tangle&quot; of a directed graph, which allows for computational &quot;states&quot;. IOTA

recently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent vulnerability.

In truth, this was a case of user-error because users were

<i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer could

crack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough now to cause

damage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum possibilities.</p>



<p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Social

useablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun to emerge, at least in form,

with little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd generation Patrician directed graph blockchain.

The underlying principle of the blockchain&#39;s micro-economic utiliity through crypto-

<i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions for Supply

&amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of the Hard Sciences of

Mathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Blockchains, Bitcoins and The Unnecessary Risk of Shopping at Target with a Credit Card, Part III:

<br />

<br /> Seven Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy

<br />

<small class="jargon">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! The first 3 of 7 new possibilities thanks to the programmable

blockchain.</small>

</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">The guiding light through the centuries of scientific paradigms, in the Kuhnian sense

<sup id="19-1">1</sup>, have derived from deductive ideas from above - whether priestly or royal decree. Then, the primacy of the

<i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then other Paradigm

Shifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment authors of 17th, 18th

century. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era&#39;s emerging paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority

and responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment.

<i>Historical Materialism</i>

<sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from governmental,

financial sources, but rather the

<i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the revolutionary

shift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable data-sharing. Cryptography

has in a sense become a

<i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property.</p>



<p>

<strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong>

<br /> Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical proof, rather

than exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern period also has held this

decentralized, individual authority as the

<i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions of humankind,

not idealogies. In fact, it was the

<i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western Philosophy,

by laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical &quot;ground&quot; upward. This &quot;upside-down

tree&quot; defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of

<i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism, as argued

in Sartre&#39;s

<i>Search for a Method</i>.

<sup>3</sup>

</p>



<p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations since Hegel.

I&#39;m so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels. First, cryptography

resemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern social rule (Some once thought

nuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown. Secondly, I&#39;m still dumbfounded that

a Paradigm Shift

<i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for a society that

is provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!</p>



<p>

<strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong>

</p>



<p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon thousands of

open-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum Virtual Machine, whose

aims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for removing the &quot;middle-person&quot;

from the day-to-day, micro-economic &quot;cost of living&quot;. This goes for for the exchanging of titles, legal

documents, etc.</p>



<p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing necessity in allocating

increasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of

<i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms on the near

horizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on

<i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient by means of

blockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing, etc.</p>



<p>

<strong>III. Removing Double-Dipping from International Remittances </strong>

</p>



<p>

<i>&quot;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&quot;

</i>

<br /> --Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, 1939</p>



<p>Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute;

la Western Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. The existing remittance system (not speaking

to

<i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian friend&#39;s

Canadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national payments systems,

thus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut. Like everything else--c&#39;est la vie. Or is it?

The beauty of Ethereum is that it &quot;talks&quot; well with others and across borders, while Bitcoin remains of

little use for micro-transactions that involve semi-basic calculations. The reason being that Bitcoin blockchain

language, Script, cannot support loops (while statements, etc.)</p>



<p>Currently, both EOS and Ethereum blockchains appear poised for the most financial-friendly blockchain tech.</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Blockchains, Bitcoins and The Unnecessary Risk of Shopping at Target with a Credit Card, Part IV:

<br />

<br /> Seven Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy

<br />

<small class="jargon">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! The 4th through 7th outlined Features of the New Blockchain

Micro-Economy</small>

</h6>

&nbsp;



<p class="firstparagraph">I feel that data is one of the more underestimated new commodities of the age. Most visualize data as rows and columns,

and at most only non-conditional dynamic data. Data are not so mute! Data, in most object-oriented languages at

least, represents

<i>functions</i>, conditions, and predicted values. And so, our own behavior, coupled with our networks&#39; behavior,

coupled with predictive analytics--this represents a wealth of information beyond our attributed or inherited traits.

The programming is

<i>in</i> the data, however, citizens have become less and less involved, ceding app by centralized app our own information

and ensuring profit to 3rd party marketers. The centralized nature of the internet allows for this, while the new

landscape of

<i>decentralized applications</i> (DAPP) completely upends this structure of the status quo.</p>



<p>

<strong>IV. Enabling citizens to own &amp; monetize their data (&amp; protect privacy)</strong>

<br /> Ethereum offers a decentralized solution to &quot;owning&quot; one&#39;s own data, as data can be decentralized

and returned to the individual&#39;s control, and

<i>profit</i>. As sure as the 19th century&#39;s &quot;labor-hour&quot; became commodified to a calculable asset, i.e.

property, which

<i>another</i> party controls and makes profit; And as sure as the 20th century&#39;s data analytics became commodified

into calculable assets for another party to take control and make profit; then only now in this 21st century does

technology offer a new, more egalitarian path.</p>



<p>

<strong>V. Ensuring compensation for the Creators of Value </strong>

<br /> So, how would decentralized innovations of blockchain

<i>distributed ledger</i> technology compensate those whose actions, behavior, opinions, friend-networks, artwork,

music, videos and other contributions profit the creator?</p>



<p>

<strong>VI. The Halcyon Age of Transaction-Chain Enterprise</strong>

</p>



<p class="quote">According to Greek Mythology, the days of eery, noticeable lack of storms have never been interpreted as a period

of grace. Moreso,

<i>Halcyon</i> tranquility only means a temporary moratorium on the winds and waves, imposed by Aeolus, God of Wind,

to protect the nesting eggs of Alcyone, his daughter.</p>



<p>If blockchain tech changes how we do research, analysis, and forecasting, as much as it changes international, and

cross-industry transactions, then are we faced with a similar dilemma as the &quot;novelty&quot;, and double-dealing,

of multi-nationals of the 1990s? No, because blockchain renders organizations, even those with a spotty past, into

transparent, democratic, efficient, secure and easily scrutinized.</p>



<p>After all, without transparent proof, how else would I know my bananas are the &quot;pura vida&quot; Costa Rique&ntilde;

ones? More importantly, what was the carbon footprint of that banana&#39;s journey from its native soil to my breakfast

table? New blockchain companies like

<a href="https://www.provenance.org/">Provenance.org</a>,

<a href="http://www.skuchain.com/" target="_blank">skuchain</a>,

<a href="http://www.blockverify.io/">http://www.blockverify.io/</a> are a few noticeable game-changers. So, for bananas not backed by mathematical proofs,

I really have to ask myself, is it

<i>really</i> an authentic Fair Trade banana?</p>



<p>Transactions are hardly valuable in the products themselves, if removed from the value of the

<i>transaction per se</i>. International supply chain transactions, by virtue of a recently possible decentralized,

permanent record and monitoring, have begun to make inroads in agriculture, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, food-supply

and other multi-stage industries.</p>



<p>If corporate and governmental transactions are to be made public--many bearing enterprise or State secrets, then

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Facebook-Friendly Third-Generation Data Structures</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Today, I&#39;m going to write about data structures, and challenges that face Vitalik Buterin and other blockchain

architects. &#39; Now, why in the

<i>world</i> would I or anyone else care about ooh, merge sorts, bubble sorts, classificatory trees, and the advent

of a third form of data structure?</p>



<p>Today, we live in an ever more relational world. With all our technology, we just can&#39;t wait to hear the latest

gossip about sister Becky&#39;s Boyfriend&#39;s Brother&#39;s Friend that

<i>also</i> got to meet Shakira. Gossip to one person is a valuable asset to the data analyst. Because, how else could

an algorithm draw simultaneous conclusions about two friends that &quot;liked&quot; the same Samsung VR, and that

they are both located near Best Buy. Thanks to classificatorial wisdom of AI &amp; plain machine-learning?</p>



<p>These relational queries are simply too difficult for relational, row &amp; column SQL data structures. In fact,

many queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures. Next, with the need to &quot;objectify&quot;

data into non-relational objects, rather than an antiquated, rigid row-and-column design. Thus, the second major

type of data structure is more flexible and adept in finding these relational queries that are ever more in vogue.

However, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational, No-SQL designs quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability.

Between a rock and a hard place, a third data structure has emerged in recent years.</p>



<p>Graph Data Structures

<sup>2</sup> allow data queries that had otherwise been impossible to capture in an entity relationship diagram. The

ideal example to clarify is the manner that the Swiss banks&#39; accounts were discovered to be hiding vast amounts

of hidden taxes, etc. The cover-up was so well-constructed that not until new, graph database queries discovered

patterns of money flow

<sup>1</sup>:</p>



<p class="quote">The data was then turned into a graph format to detect then fine-tune the connections between the nodes. The Swiss

Leak held around 60,000 files that contained information about over 100,000 clients in 203 countries, which means

that the resulting graph database had more than 275,000 nodes with 400,000 relationships among them.</p>



<p class="quote">By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections

than they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and regulators

across the globe.</p>



<p>And you thought that plagiarism-detecting software was impressive for complexity! The beauty of this newly available

software (even Microsoft jumped on board in recent years) means that sociologists, economists can begin to make

better headway in the way that our many interactions become more complex with more data. Remember, in the past ten

minutes, more data information was just produced than most of human history! Thus, new and upcoming needs in domains

like content management &amp; access control, geo-routing (public transportation), gene sequencing, bio-informatics,

and so on. So, as technology takes us forward, and we make our considerations, let&#39;s stick by the golden rules

of parallel processing, scalability, and, now, graph-network mindedness for the new data structures, and schema,

of the Era!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber">Feb 22, 2018</h6>



<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Languages</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">While I&#39;ve had blockchain-related topics on the mind lately, it seems I can&#39;t escape it as I broach new fields--blockchain

is everywhere! Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated speed of language and syntax formation,

and the curious phenomenon I&#39;d call, for lack of a better word or or my own reading, &quot;declarative-syntax-merging&quot;.

This involves the curious, and largely unknown, growth of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain

of web apps, data analysis, and even the bounds of

<i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won&#39;t submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say that, &quot;If

a certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed in JavaScript.&quot;</p>



<p>Without getting into technicals, I&#39;ll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged with

French, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand years later,

we can see how English grammar inherited it&#39;s Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the core vocabulary;

Then, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;house&quot;

from &quot;melche&quot; or &quot;haus&quot;, then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from

French, e.g. &quot;lactose&quot; or &quot;mansion&quot; from &quot;lait&quot; or &quot;maison&quot;.</p>



<p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new language called

Solidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English&#39;s time. The usual FOMO logic propels coding language use,

for example FOMO induced Microsoft&#39;s flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt it years ago.

<sup id="22-1">1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents, one non-legitimate.

It is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of C++. For the layperson, let&#39;s

just say Solidity resembles a &quot;Liger&quot;, in it is at it&#39;s core JavaScript, yet with increasing sophistication

based on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the powerful machine-code of C++ ever more. And it

is a beautiful, but curious phenomonenon.</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">1.4 Million Reasons for more Women in Tech</h6>

<a href="#18-03-08" rel="stylesheet">Blog addressed again March 8, 2018 </a>



<p class="firstparagraph">1.4 million

<i>new</i> jobs by 2020; End over end, year after year, the computer programming industry continues to add another

20% more jobs each year, for the next five years. This is the only field that demand outstrips the supply--and increasingly

short supply. So much so, the US Department of Labor forecasts U.S. citizens will be able to fill 39% of those positions;

there are not enough Immigration visas (especially in the Trumpian era of isolationism) to make up the rest.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, how is it that only 14% of females in the entire field of cybersecurity? Silicon Valley is, at its best, obscenely

one-sided. At Google, only 17% of the company&#39;s tech jobs are filled by women. Facebook women staff only 15%

of tech jobs, and Twitter? 10% female. The figures on women in computer science across the nation, across the entire

industry are not improving, but

<i>declining</i>?

<sup>1</sup>

</p>



<p>Of course, we&#39;ve heard these statistics from any given headline, and in the halls across the university landscape,

starting with Women in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Mathematics) programs.

<sup>3</sup> Yet, why, with so much money, so many programs, so many non-governmental, non-profit effort?</p>



<p>I argue that tech

<i>climate </i> is directly to blame. Who then? Not a person, but principles are to blame. Culture--often defined as

shared beliefs, norms, language and behaviors--can hardly be changed, but it can be understood.

<br /> There is a book, called &quot;Program or be Programmed

<sup id="24-4">4</sup>

</p>

, by which the author explains social consequences of a dichotomized society--between those that manipulate the environment

around them, whether automating tasks at work, or simply fixing a simple software bug, by adding a comma. This literacy

of the Current Era is akin to the 26-letter alphabet of written sentences and paragraphs, and--not to be taken for

granted--is the exclusive form of communication, outside of a 100-foot perimeter, up until 150 years ago. Knowledge

is not power, the communication of knowledge is power.



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I argue that today, the power is to program one application programming interface (API) to talk to another API. In

other words, the ability to directly communicate with software at the command-line is not now a requisite skill,

but promotions would not escape this necessity! So, now reverting back to the subject of women in tech, American

leadership is in deep peril without more female insight. I will finish by citing that Ares, the violent, untamed

Greek

<i>god of war</i>, cannot always drive the Capitalist engine; because She, Athena, the

<i>goddess of intelligence</i> represents true strategy!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Joys of Automation</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">While coding up a better shell for this website, I thought it&#39;s remarkable how our lives get easier and easier

with each passing year of tech. Using JavaScript--the primordial web-coding language--I marvel at the convenience

of delegating mundande coding stuff to taskrunners, like

<i>Gulp</i>--a programmable package manager that &quot;bundles&quot; up the libraries to be used in the app. It is

truly a joy!</p>



<p>I write four styling

<i>functions</i>, with about 16

<i>variables</i> and voil&agrave;! I finish in 3 hours what would have taken me 15 hours, then another 5 hours a month

for upkeep. Instead, now, it&#39;s as though I wind up the clock, and need only periodically check, and perhaps

update a variable or two ... Technology. I&#39;m gushing for joy.</p>



<p>This was mere JavaScript--with a truly

<i>Turing Complete</i>--pan-algorithm status--languages, the possibilities are 100-fold with Python language library

collection; this library collection includes NASA modules, mathematical proofs, and limitless uses from web-scraping

for unstructured data to an excellent data visualization collection. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m in the Library

of Congress, and better yet because, PIP, the Python package manager acts and automates like a cyborg librarian,

for lack of better imagery.</p>



<p>I just have so much joy watching a project come to life, and it&#39;s even a greater delight if this project comes

to life and stays alive, through the joys of automation!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Cryptocurrency&#39;s Cumbersome Carbon Footprint</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">I must confess that on the very day that Our Daily Tech Blog gets an under-the-head make-over for security&#39;s

sake, I wrote the new formatting file right over today&#39;s post. Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously

as I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether I change my

ways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely, Sustainability, a.k.a.

Carbon Footprint.</p>



<p class="quote">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms that build

a record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a bitcoin for their efforts.

<sup id="explain">1</sup>

</p>



<p>Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high electricity

bills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity is gobbled up by small

and large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations!

<sup id="electricity">1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other &quot;Proof-of-Work&quot; designs require electricity because

the investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for mining drives

the system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations.</p>



<p>So, is the electricity consumption really

<i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis site

<sup

id="digiconomist">3</sup> estimates

<i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity&#39;s mining. (A visa credit card transaction

is 0.00651 kWh. The entire Ethereum global blockchain could be &quot;using as much as 4.2 Terawatt-hours (tWh),

or slightly more than the country of Cyprus

<sup id="cyprus">1</sup>.&quot; So, electricity comparisons are telling, but how does this relate to its environment impact, sustainability

itself?</p>



<p>Carbon Footprint, our energy consumption index, can be compared to another element of scarcity, which dictates fluctuations

in value: Gold. According to

<i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household&#39;s Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article does

the math for us very succinctly:</p>



<p class="quote">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just more energy-intensive, but also has

a bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon footprint for both.

For Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. For gold, we assume a carbon

footprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined

<sup id="digiconomist2">3</sup>.</p>



<p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin&#39;s worth

of Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2). At the end of the day, the electricity costs--if not sustainable long-term--could

spell trouble. Hence, the three S&#39;s, mentioned last, sustainability is perhaps a larger issue than blockchain

Security and Scalability challenges. Again, this is a problem that the third largest cryptocurrency does not have:

<i>Ripple</i>, which does not bear a carbon footprint

<sup id="ripple">4</sup>.</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">After Yesterday&#39;s Scathing Post, A Look at my own Carbon Footprint</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">In my reflections about environment sustainability issues, I confess I&#39;m sort of a hypocrite ... The whole matter

that caused my own introspection begins with my usual daily vexation: Tangles of wires!

<br /> &nbsp; ... I&#39;ve been having electricity issues, here as of late ...</p>



<p>On one side, my tiny Yoga Ultrabook usually likes to charge just fine with my phone charger--if I&#39;m stuck without

my charger. And due to an untimely end to the charger, I needed a replacement. So, singular errand of the day was

a trip to Best Buy to peruse for a 45-Watt USB-C charger ( the new oval charging port on Samsung 8&#39;s, LG G6&#39;s

and newer Apple products).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, my credit-card sized Raspberry Pi computer runs on an old-school USB charger--a whole Linux Server Tower

on a cell-phone charger. Then, we have my trusty Dell (actual) Tower with 16 Gigs of RAM, 2-terabytes, etc. that

also seems to need an extra fan to stay cool--probably the sustainability of 100 Raspberry computers. My entire

carbon footprint changes more with the electrical products that I use, than my vehicle! Well, I also confess my

Jeep Cherokee can&#39;t even boast 20 miles per hour ... oops, conscience pangs, ouch ... Well, hypocritical, slightly,

but found not guilty since I&#39;m a bike-commuter for life!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">One Last Word about Bitcoin&#39;s Carbon Footprint</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">Environmental Sustainability, again, and a higher-level view of the dilemmea...I couldn&#39;t resist:

<br /> Bitcoin&#39;s Initial Coin Offering was 2011 or so, then Ethereum, with Ether for currency was 2015; These two,

ever so prescient designs, also have their Achilles Heal. These two are

<strong>&quot;Proof of Work&quot; currency algorithsms</strong>. This means that the &quot;Demand&quot; side of supply-and-demand,

derives from

<i>difficulty levels</i> of crypto-blocks to mine. So, miners are incentivized to spend $1500 on a semi-mediocre-good

mining rig (which is basically 20 NVIDIA Graphics Cards tied together to stack of two-by-fours with lots of fans

... erhem, sustainability?...</p>



<p>And for each block that is &quot;solved&quot;, hence the block being validated, and somebody&#39;s cryptocurrency

purchase/transaction is resolved! (takes about 12 minutes for the whole global blockchain to cycle, and Ethereum

is less than a minute). So, the whole cycle continues, churning through coal- and carbon-stained hands of the electricity

fed to these crypto-mining rigs

<sup>1</sup>. For many it&#39;s a hobby, like the British Hobbyists&#39; love for ham- and short-wave radio setups, yet

this profitable, yet particular hobby resembles the 1870&#39;s coal factory smoke stacks in South London!</p>



<p>Let&#39;s face it, if Ethereum is able to successfully hard-fork to a Proof-of-Stake system soon--and Vitalik Buterin

and his crew assure us it is coming

<sup>2</sup>--then great--problem solved, everything eventually converts to Ethereum. If

<i>not</i>they face an existential threat. Because, in a more enlightened ten years from now, those mining depots

<i>would</i> look like unfettered factory smoke-stacks. Proof-of-Stack, whose currency value is not set to difficult

of algorithm puzzle (hence,

<i>proof-of-work</i>, but rather to ownership of &quot;voting pools&quot;, which is a

<i>

<strong>Consensus-Based Blockchain algorithm</strong>

</i> [Complex subject best reserved for a rainy day, or better yet, no day! I may revisit this alternative in a funner

way, here&#39;s a glimpse from Vitalk&#39;s @VitalikButerin tweet yesterday:</p>



<p class="quote">Question for mathematicians: is there a assumed-to-be-normal number (ie. digits are random, like pi or e) where you

can calculate the nth digit in log(n) (or even polylog(n)) time? If so, then H(x) = digits[x ... x+100] seems like

it would be a cool cryptographic hash algo.</p>



<p>Now, I am by no means a detective, but by the sound of those tweets, the Proof-of-Work algorithm seems to still be

of utmost importance ...</p>

The decentralized app (DAPP) developers have no such luxury, except to abide by a certain golden rule; a single rule that sustains crypto-tech's very existence: The Rule of Trust, without which blockchain tech has nothing to offer. 
</p>
<p>The very premise of designing distributed ledger platforms hinges on placing a platform's cryptographic, algorthmic design at the center, the link between every user. <i>This trust, built on mathematical proofs, ensures peer-to-peer transactions in which  <i>neither party needs to trust the counterparty, nor any third-party.</i>We trust in the math that our transaction will be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="quote">“I think great artists and great engineers are similar, in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicians on the side.” <sup>1</sup><br /> – Steve Jobs</p><br />
<p class="firstparagraph">Words, Sentences, Paragraphs. Variables, Functions, Modules.  With so many languages used for different purposes by different organizations, syntax is more than 4-space indents, variable name-spaces, and other formalities. Today, the variety of coding languages and scripts can appear more complicated than is the case: After all, all computer <i>languages boil down to the same primary tasks: for &amp; while loops, if-then statements, variable declarations, scope considerations, etc ...</i>     
</p>
<p>So what am I getting at? Coding innovation is an art form that surpasses science and knowledge. For example,   coding practices improve with clarity, simplicity, modularity, and so on... but is there an authoritative <i>school of thought</i> on this art? Well, in the Python world, all eyes turn to the Zen of Python, and some say other languages should emulate its philosophy, so let's hear it:</p>
<p class="quote">
<strong>The Zen of Python</strong><br /><br />

Beautiful is better than ugly.<br /><br />

Explicit is better than implicit.<br /> <br />

Simple is better than complex.<br /> <br />

Complex is better than complicated.<br /> <br />

Flat is better than nested.<br /> <br />

Sparse is better than dense.<br /> <br />

Readability counts.<br /> <br />

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br /><br />

Although practicality beats purity.<br /><br />

Errors should never pass silently.<br /><br />

Unless explicitly silenced.<br /><br />

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br /><br />

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br /><br />

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br /><br />

Now is better than never.<br />
<br />
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br /><br />

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br /><br />

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br /><br />

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! <sup>2</sup><br />

<br />
--Pythoneer Tim Peters
</p>
<p>I get it, good coding is more than intuitive art, it's walking the high road without regard for shortcuts. And I can see that <i>in uncharted waters, intuition has to be constrained by sound reason.</i> And who hasn't been burned by artful exploration, fancy coding, and far-fetched architectures? So where does the balance lie? Again we must turn to Steve Jobs on the "intersection of the humanities and science,": </p>
<p class="quote">There are a lot of people innovating, and that's not the main distinction of my career. The reason Apple resonates with people is that there's a deep current of humanity in our innovation. I think great artists and great engineers are simi.ar in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicans on the side. In the seventies computers became a way for people to express their creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great art science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a sculptor." <sup>1</sup><br />--Steve Jobs
<p class="continue">I could not imagine a computing world were it not for the personalization that Apple introduced to the world, to us all. After all, I recall I was first transfixed in 1984, there I was a seven-year-old staring into the bright green letters   of my   Apple IIe ... </p>
<p>So, in this era of the algorithmic wild-west and impending regulations on data privacy, inter-app permissions, coupled with data breaches every week, how might regulations avoid stifling innovation? Steve Jobs didn't have rules as much as Mark Zuckerberg didn't have any rules. So, it's a relief that Zuckerberg, with intimate knowledge of innovation, can set his teams to work with Congress going forward, especially as Facebook conforms to the E.U.'s <i>General Data Privacy Regulations (GDPR) implementation this May.</i> I for one hope that freedom for creative innovation will stay alive, even in the face of   growing bureaucracy in the web.

<h6    class="  chapternumber">April 18, 2018<br />  </h6>   
<h6    class="dailytitle chapternumber">Blockchain Types and Trade-offs
</h6>  

<p class="firstparagraph">Bitcoin's rise to prominence, the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto's identity--i.e., author of <a href="dist/docs/bitcoinWhitePaper.pdf" target="_blank"> the original Bitcoin White Paper</a>, and the platform's reliability (outside of value fluctuations) all add to the mystique of the crypto-currency.  Yet,     new advances and types, i.e. "groupings" of blockchain technology are not necessarily "replacing" their predecessors, but rather filling different blockchain needs; Needs that include speed of transactions, truly public distributed ledgers, safety from forking and DDOS attacks.  Since 2008,   groups of competing platforms follow a timeline, but should not be thought of as a cyclical evolution but rather growing tree branches that form "groups".  Bitcoin, Litecoin are first generation, while Ethereum and Ripple are 2nd generation with crypto-contract capability, and finally Iota and Swirlds' Hedera Hashgraph represent   3rd generation <i>directed-acyclic-graphs (DAG), whose transaction speed actually  increases</i> with number of nodes.
</p>
<p>Each of these groupings shouldn't be seen as making the previous design obselete: They   serve different purposes. Bitcoin can never serve micro-transactions and the micro-economy because it can only handle 6 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum can handle 12 or so. However, micro-transaction industries require TPS in the hundreds of thousands! Only the 3rd gen  crypto-currency architecture   achieves TPS <i>ad infinitum</i> because it's scalability increases with size. The catch? DAG's are necessarily private entities, rather than the original two generations that are by nature public, yet can be privatized. 3rd generation DAGs are the opposite: They are by default private, and cannot truly be distributed without management. Further, <i>Swirlds Hashgraph has patented their source code, which contradicts many principles of blockchain technology</i>, beginning with core tenets  of the original crypto-currency white paper, published in October 2008. For history
's sake, here's a quick view of the Bitcoin paper's abstract:</p>
<p class="quote"><strong>Abstract.</strong> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled byi nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Irrespective of crypto-currency or crypto-contract, there seems to be a different kind of jump from 2nd generation to 3rd generation blockchain, rather than a progression. Research needed to fork into a different direction is because of the need for instantaneous, ordered transactions, which can never be provided by a blockchain design which "syncs" every 5 to 10 minutes. </p>
<p> So, what is this 3rd generation design? Instead of a singular block encapsulated in linked cryptographic, historical ledger blocks, hashgraph uses a "tangle" of one-way (directed-acyclic) network connections. This means that speed increases with the number of nodes, overcoming the Bitcoin micro-transaction problem. <i>In sum, near-instantaneous updates for financial, betting, gaming and social-media data needs are solved by the  third-generation DAG</i>, while longer-term and truly distributed blockchain needs will always be the terrain of first and second generation blockchain technology. So, given that Swirlds' Hedera Hashgraph will be unveiling their platform next month,   blockchain critics and enthusiasts can and should read between the lines, er, I mean-- read  between the nodes ...</p><br />

</h6>  
<p class="firstparagraph">Dictionaries and libraries place the programmer into a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ride the lightning of the open-source community. Volunteers and corporate sponsors take the credit for the enormous effort making a  near limitless selection of functions, dictionaries and modules for languages such as  JavaScript and Python programming.<sup>1</sup> Today, a programmer can   put together JavaScript Components and Modules with less thought about syntactical logic, and more consideration for the problem at hand. 
</p>  
<p class="quote">Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in just one place in the source code. Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts.</br ></br >
--Benjamin C. Pierce</p>
<p>There are a few hundred thousand packages in the JavaScript <i> Node.js package ecosystem</i>, with billions of downloads per month. This unprecedented global collaboration, sharing open-source code into the community, means a more humanized, higher-level programming tasks-- a boon for the many coding-converts joining the tech economy. Such optimism means that problem-solving is fast and flexible, especially in the world of Stack Overflow--another phenomenon of global collaboration.
</p>
<p class="quote">[Abstraction] tries to factor out details from a common pattern so that programmers can work close to the level of human thought, leaving out details which matter in practice, but are immaterial to the problem being solved.</p>

<p class="quote">The effective exploitation of the powers of <i>abstraction</i> must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a   programmer ...<sup>2</sup> <br /><br />
--Edsger W. Dijkstra</p>
<p>These words mean programmers can do what they do best, as much as   what the client-user does best, too: think and problem-solve like a human, rather than a robot. </p>

<p class="firstparagraph">E.U.'s Parliament has   invited Zuckerberg to speak with member-states in Brussels to discuss both the upcoming <i>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</i> new rules, along with the 2.7 Europeans, whose data also was sold to Cambridge Analytica.<sup>1</sup> Not exactly an invitation to the Ball...

<p>These are more than talking points, as they are already codified within the GDPR and to implemented next month--compliance with European law will be a mad dash for developers.</p>
<p> This predicament illuminates a smaller world, along with increasing complications of globalization, thanks to tech--for better or worse. Ultimately, Facebook, Google, and other tech giants will need to overhaul their permissioning code to abide by European law, but after last week's Congressional appearence, it's hard not to wonder if pan-industry data privacy adjustments will lead to a new <i>de facto regulation</i>, based on tech culture instead of politicians and legislators ...

</h6>  
<p class="firstparagraph">This week, the Supreme Court   revisits its 1992 decision not requiring state sales taxes for online purchases.<sup>1</sup> Although big-box stores like Amazon, Walmart, etc. <i>do</i> pay state taxes among the 45 states requiring it, small- and medium-sized retailers do not need to collect sales taxes in any state where they do not have physical presence, also known as "nexus." But, beginning this Tuesday, the free ride may come to an  end; this includes small retailers that comprise half of Amazon's 3rd-party online sales.
</p>
<p class="quote">  

A reversal could mean that all online retailers must collect sales tax everywhere. It's an issue that brick-and-mortar retailers insist will provide a level playing field with online competitors, and help to provide state and local governments with the tax revenue they deserve.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p> Livelihoods hang in the balance, so whatever the gavel settles on, let's hope for the best! The Blockbuster-ization of so many brick-and-mortars seems to claim a new victim every month--recently Toys 'R Us  meeting its demise.<sup>3</sup> So, with as many that have disappeared, big and small-, its a curiosity if maybe Tuesday breathes life into the boarded store-fronts across America. I think others share my view that shopping is more than shiny packaging at the doorstep: it's much more the ceremony and gala in the store - a  real shared moment with strangers, acquaintances and loved ones that makes for better packaging, a package embellished with a story.

Bitcoins &amp; Browsers: A Glance at Bitcoin Distributed Mining  
</h6> 

<p class="firstparagraph">For all the clamor about Bitcoin's carbon footprint, who doesn't love the sound of money?  And, for all the pitfalls of Iota and the ever-evolving Ethereum (and ever-present threat of forking), Bitcoin stands true among the crypto-currency platforms. Keeping it Simple,   the very limited, non-crypto-contract may just be Bitcoin's virtue. In a rocky world, <i>a plain, no-frills crypto-currency with stability</i> is incomparable to crypto-contract powers, that are not fully stable, like Ethereum and Iota.  </p>
<p>So, it's living the dream, but must it be so cost-intensive? Maybe, Maybe not, but where does the future lie for all that hardware? Where does the browser fit into this? First, what's going on under the hood: Note this article is older, but accurate in explanation--except for references to Bitcoin's value! </p>  

<p class="quote">New bitcoins are created roughly every 10 minutes in batches of 25 coins, with each coin worth around $730 at current rates. [A typical home-] computer ... is racing thousands of others to unlock and claim the next batch.</p>
<p class="quote">
Let’s start with what it’s not doing.  
Your computer is not blasting through the cavernous depths of the internet in search of digital ore that can be fashioned into bitcoin bullion. There is no ore, and bitcoin mining doesn’t involve extracting or smelting anything. It’s called mining only because the people who do it are the ones who get new bitcoins, and because bitcoin is a finite resource liberated in small amounts over time, like gold, or anything else that is mined. (The size of each batch of coins drops by half roughly every four years, and around 2140, it will be cut to zero, capping the total number of bitcoins in circulation at 21 million.) But the analogy ends there.
</p><p class="quote">
What bitcoin miners actually do could be better described as competitive bookkeeping. Miners build and maintain a gigantic public ledger containing a record of every bitcoin transaction in history. Every time somebody wants to send bitcoins to somebody else, the transfer has to be validated by miners: They check the ledger to make sure the sender isn’t transferring money she doesn’t have. If the transfer checks out, miners add it to the ledger. Finally, to protect that ledger from getting hacked, miners seal it behind layers and layers of computational work—too much for a would-be fraudster to possibly complete.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>So all of this hard work <i>can be distributed</i> across browsers, which improves its energy-expensive plight. I wouldn't recommend running the demo in the article link below as it may overheat your device--it had my fan running double-time. But the internals are using JavaScript code for the math. Here's a look under the hood, and it's nice to see the role of <i>JavaScript graphics library, called D3JS, (Data Driven Documents)</i> playing a central role. So, below you see the browser accepting the SHA256 Hash along with the Bitcoin Owner's Address, and the JavaScript in the browser passes off calculations to the C++ running the JavaScript V8 engine on your computer. </p>
<img src="./dist/img/miningBlockchainD3.PNG" class="zoom" width="450px" />
<p>And so, what does it mean to mine Bitcoins across browsers in a distributed fashion? It is similar to the same concept as Ethereum's direction (or at least idealized by its architect, Vitalik Buterin), in running the Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain across all the browsers that download its GETH software. Nonetheless, here's a succinct explanation of the browser's role,again from Quartz: </p>
<p class="quote">Mining’s ultimate purpose is to prevent people from double-spending bitcoins. But it also solves another problem. It distributes new bitcoins in a relatively fair way—only those people who dedicate some effort to making bitcoin work get to enjoy the coins as they are created.
But because mining is a competitive enterprise, miners have come up with ways to gain an edge. One obvious way is by pooling resources.<br /><br />


Your machine, right now, is actually working as part of a bitcoin mining collective that shares out the computational load. Your computer is not trying to solve the block, at least not immediately. It is chipping away at a cryptographic problem, using the input at the top of the screen and combining it with a nonce [run-time, generated random number calculated only once, then discarded], then taking the hash to try to find a solution. Solving that problem is a lot easier than solving the block itself, but doing so gets the pool closer to finding a winning nonce for the block. And the pool pays its members in bitcoins for every one of these easier problems they solve.</p>
<p>In practice, distributed mining pays off quite well   for the owners of that address. My blogposts on <a href="# <a href="#18-02-28">February 26th  </a> and <a href="#18-02-28">Feb. 28th about blockchain sustainability</a> paint a less rosy picture of tying the currency value to the cost of energy, but multiple solutions and fixes exist to distribute the energy load to laptops on clean renewables, the mining cooperative way ... after all, who ever said money had to be so expensive? </a> 
<p class="cite">1.<a href="https://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-page-you-are-mining-bitcoins/" target="_blank">https://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-page-you-are-mining-bitcoins/

</h6> 
  <p class="firstparagraph">  Data privacy regulation's challenge begins with five million apps between Apple and Android stores. Countless vulnerabilities, not to mention different standards and languages across the app world. <i>Like all Tech problems,</i>scalability requires Tech problem-solving--</i>in this case implying artificial intelligence.  About A.I., Zuckerberg remarks:</p>  
  <p class="quote"> There are some really nuanced questions, though, about how to regulate [data] which I think are extremely interesting intellectually. So the biggest one that I’ve been thinking about is this question of: To what extent should companies have a responsibility to use AI tools to kind of self-regulate content?<sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>However such musing goes, the European Union's May 14th implementation takes a <i>direct stand against the concept of algorithm use with data</i>, which begs the A.I. question again. </p>
  <p class="quote">The European law gives individuals the right not to be subject to completely automated  decisions which significantly affect them. These decisions could include credit algorithms that use an individual’s data to decide whether a bank should grant him or her a loan.  
      Privacy International said the clause on automated decisions could allow consumers to challenge Facebook practices like political advertising, which can be sent to users based on algorithms, because the ads are meant to sway users’ votes.<sup>2</sup></p>
  <p>I think the E.U. data policy model is intelligent - who would have thought to re-humanize our personal data   by taking it away from algorithms, without our permission. I like that, after all, who likes to be unknowingly judged? Least of all by a robot!

<h6    class="dailytitle chapternumber">When a Pickpocket is Pickpocketed:<br />Part III. The Path toward Sound Data Privacy Policy
</h6> 
<p class="firstparagraph">Day two of Congressional hearings over Facebook's Data Privacy and Protections  were better articulated than the first day. Important dialogue surrounded primarily   two data privacy topics: First, financial transparency surrounding ads and political ads based on the <i>Honest Ads Act</i>, for which Zuckerberg pledged support<sup>1</sup>. 
</p>
<p>Second, and   more far-reaching, discussion of the <i>Browser Act</i> also was raised by several House members. While responding to the Act's sponsor, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Zuckerberg expressed interest in working together. This bill is not well known, but aims to set prudent, consistent guidelines of privacy in the hands of the consumer. </p>
<p class="quote"> [Blackburn's] new bill targets the full spectrum of the internet, including web giants like Amazon and Google. In Blackburn’s words, it moves the government “to a posture where we have one regulator, one set of rules [and] everybody knows who’s in charge,” she told Recode.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>So, however the power struggle goes, a <i>shared technology lexicon</i> clarifies that shades of meaning make enormous difference, depending on "what" an entity is--whether a technology is a Platform as a Service  versus media outlet or strictly merchant-based. Hopefully, <i>Tech will lead the way</i> without ceding authority in the process: </p>
<p class="quote">
  But the Tennessee lawmaker’s effort hasn’t won any allies among privacy-conscious consumer groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, which doubt Blackburn’s methods. And her bill has already prompted a whole new round of fierce lobbying by tech and telecom giants, which don’t see the need for any new regulation at all.
  </p> 
<p class="quote">
“I think that, in concept, the idea that there should be stronger privacy standards for edge providers and internet service providers is right,” said Neema Singh Guliani, the legislative counsel at the ACLU.</p>
<p class="quote">
But Blackburn, she added, should have gone about it differently. “The way to do it was not ... [through] gutting the FCC’s rules; the way to do it was actively working on a replacement.”<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>The bill is similar to the European data privacy model, <i>E.U. General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)</i>, which serves as point of reference.<sup>2</sup> On May 14,   Europeans will   be implementing a pan-internet--edge and ISP--data protections, which include e-mail, Facebook and other apps, equally as for Comcast and Verizon, and industry-wide privacy defaults; Further, opt-in for privacy is more meaningful separate, and  not relegated to the main Terms and Conditions.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Policy regulation in other industries--exemplified by medical <i>HIPAA</i>, financial <i>Fair Credit   Reporting Act</i>--reveals the noticeable absence of similar policy in Tech. Tech's regulation is however necessarily far more complex, involving at minimum trade-offs between app-to-app data portability and new boundaries for different sources and forms of data. Clearly, the browser-based, high-security HTTPS Encryption I mentioned in my <a href="#18-04-06">April 6 three-part series on Progressive Web Apps </a>will undoubtedly be used for quick, inexpensive data privacy compliance, <i>a real boon for JavaScript developers</i>--as if there wasn't enough work already!

<h6    class="dailytitle chapternumber">When a Pickpocket is Pickpocketed:<br />  Part II:  "Semantic Polymorphism", i.e., Double Talk about  Data 
</h6> 
<p class="firstparagraph">Mark Zuckerberg daftly played word-tennis with   Senators in the first day of Congressional Hearings on Facebook Data Privacy issues. Although, in this case, <i>there were two, at times three, tennis balls at play!</i> What I mean is that "Data" and "Personal Data" vaccilated in meaning:  At times, Senators' questions referred to, 1.) personally identifiable data with intimate personal details, full name, location data (sensitive-data); 2.) Other times questions referred to <i>derivative data, i.e. data wrangled, refined, merged with different datasets</i> (composite-data); and,  3.) sometimes the questions meant the harmless, identity-encrypted "ad-data"(anonymized-data); but, usually, Zuckerberg responded to a question about one of these three meanings of "personal data", by responding with a non-abstract fourth: 4.) "Senator, the data, the 'likes' and pictures you share with Facebook, they are your property," Zuckerberg would answer. Well, thank goodness! </p>
<p> My blogpost talks about the shades of meaning: We all know the light-hearted awkwardness when a conversation splits into two separate threads because each party unknowingly follows differing meanings from the same word, or idea.  Austin Powers would have more fun with it, but the Sociologists typically call it  a <i>Semantic Predicament</i>.<sup>1</sup></p> 
<p>In fairness, Mark Zuckerberg volunteered as he himself was not subpoenaed, and therefore this preliminary, public discourse was critical for creating shared meaning and language about a complex topic. By volunteering to engage conversation with Senators, Zuckerberg interrupts the <i>game of telephone</i>; and, Senators engage with their constituents, and lo, America saves two years' of misunderstandings for clear data-protection action now. Bravo, Mark! Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the braver CEOs in American history--Now, he has earned his place right next to Andrew Carnegie--and very similar lives, too. And now, with defined boundaries, <i>Tech has a better roadmap</i> for ethical policy and sensible regulation. So let the data debates begin--but this time,with only one   ball at play! </p>

<h6    class="dailytitle chapternumber">When a Pickpocket is Pickpocketed:<br />Part I: Facebook Data Generation and the Deepests Desires of Psychometricians, <i>Without Anonymization</i>   
</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Psychometrics, along with today's biometrics and econometrics, form the 3 primary domains of statistical research. These three fields approach research differently. Psychometricians are less causally oriented, as their tool, "factor analysis"--<i>analyse factorielle</i>--reduces complex data to dimple, categorical forms in order to reconcile <i>quantitative data</i> with intuitive categories.<sup>1.</sup> And this research is great for expanding knowledge about society. But to what end? Who's to say, after all society is both the subject <i>and</i> object of this research. Social scientists are used to these mental gymnastics, yet are bound by a certain ethos of research: <strong>Anonymization, i.e. encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from datasets</strong>. This is the Social Scientists' <i>Oath</i>--a line of decency. </p>
<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday at noon, the world will tune in to hear Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before the U.S. Congress, all to hear about Facebook &amp; company's line of decency. However indecent any revelations may be, I'm not that entirely threatened by the revelations. Maybe I won't admit I'm   prone to Social Media influence, because I chart my course. Here's more from the esteemed Abbott: </p> 

<p class="quote">“We have ended up believing that social reality is determined in the main by certain general forces, and that these generalities are then specified by combinations of forces, and further limited by various aspects of “individuality,” which in this sense is best understood as idiosyncratic higher order interaction.”<sup>1</sup> </p>
<p>And so, while academic research focuses on the "general forces" to better understand how groups work together, the <strong>bad thing that Zuckerberg did</strong> is not following in the same spirit of generality.<sup>2</sup> They chose to collect and disseminate our "likes" as much as our locations, and ... wait for the ominous music ... the <i><strong>non-FB connected mobile contacts of the Facebook clients' personal cell-phones</strong></i>--flipping through someone's personal desk drawer is definitely pushing the rules of privacy. I addressed this issue in my <a href="#18-03-20">March 20th blog post</a> on Facebook's ethics versus the long-standing data-handling ethics from Academia. Regarding tomorrow's revelations, let's remember to give the guy benefit of the doubt, even if they were handily swindled, while they were swindling us.<sup>3</sup>

On the	Inevitable Demise of   Native Mobile Apps in favor of Progressive Web Apps<br />Part III: The Nuts &amp; Bolts of the App Replacement Process</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Revolutions come and revolutions go, but the <i>2nd app revolution</i> is already underway, albeit quietly.<sup>1</sup> Most media sources refer to a "Native App - Progressive Web App Debate" with emphasis on what the native app can already do--<i>so if it's not broke, don't fix it</i>. However, implications change as the conversation turns to the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Chrome V-8 JavaScript Engine<sup>2</sup>--you know, the web-app on <i>steroids</i>! </p>
<p>So what kind of steroids you ask? Let us say that the power of the modern browser lies in the open-source JavaScript engine, first C++ variation <i>originally </i>introduced in 2008 by Google's Chromium project. Open-source<i>-who?</i> (close your eyes next paragraph for the jargon-wary!) </p>
<p class="quote">A JavaScript engine is a program or an interpreter which executes JavaScript code. A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard interpreter, or just-in-time compiler that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>In plain english, this means that the browser speaks directly to machine code, and this is a big deal. Happily 'roided, the browser now accomodates tasks that the "App" was invented for: <i>To direct service work</i>--image and data loading, caching, storage, offline data, icons, notifica       tions, etc. </p>
<p>Now, through a "Manifest" file provided to the device from the browser, all of those same tasks are accomplished through a series of handshakes, and voil&aacute;: the mobile device doesn't see the difference between a native app and, well ... a <i>progressive app!</i></p>
<p>They say History repeats itself. In our digital lifetime, we have seen <i>record sales</i> surpass digital downloads again (due to streaming); we have seen the originally-decentralized internet return, or at least begin the journey, back to decentralization! And now, we have the once-lowly browser return with a vengeance and strength to replace native apps, with encrypted security, instant loading, and <i>better</i> off-line caching! Do you have an app for that?</p>

  <p class="firstparagraph">Today's Web Browsers, &agrave; la Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc., are <i>unabashedly on steroids</i>. And, well they deserve to be--they were here first! More importantly, the browser's native language--JavaScript--has been granted full power of the entire web's backend, i.e. servers, data, todos. This means that the browser achieves instant loading, <i>fully progressive, device-responsive,</i> full <i>HTTPS</i>-encryption security, and coherent cross-browser compatibility. So that your favorite   apps look and interact the same between the array of browser choices. The Washington Post has been lauded for helping pioneer the technology. Most notably, their progressive web app loads in .9 of a second, while their native mobile app requires 2.9 seconds.<sup>3</sup> Not exactly a photo finish!</p>

  On the	Inevitable Demise of   Native Mobile Apps in favor of Progressive Web Apps<br />Part I:   Mobile Devices Outwit and Outgrow the "Old-School" App</h6>
  <p  ><small>Note on app definitions in this post: Anything downloaded, whether iOS or Android is <i>native mobile app</i>, while progressive web apps are strictly behind the HTTPS protocol, i.e. browser-based.</small></p>
<p class="firstparagraph">Mobile Devices are ever delightful, yet a pesky 2 to 3-second delay often accompanies our everyday tasks using device-native apps. For the impatient, this delay is not tolerable, and even the patient have their urgent moments (or have better things to do).    So, whether we're Verizon, T-Mobile, or pre-pay phones like Sprint's Boost, our experiences are the same: 3-second delays abound--much to our impatience!  </p>
<p >Instant Loading </p>
<p >In contrast, many of our daily web-based tasks are instant, i.e. a second or less. I feel instant loading should be <i>a right</i>, not an occasional convenience. what does this potential mean? This means an app's service workers can load nearly immediately and reliably. This means  non-choppy  animations, smooth scrolling, no matter the network connection you're using, no matter the device!  </p>
<p  >Device-Neutral User Interface</p>

<p  >After a long-day's work using desktop and mobile apps, why should an evening transition to tablet or laptop change our experience? Further, these variations differ between apps--of which there are alot:  2.2 million apps in the iTunes collection and 3 million Android apps, as of 2017<sup>2</sup>. of iOS apps &amp; 3 million. 	 My Fitbit experience is illustrative. First, I admit I have a terrible addiction to statistics, especially bio-statistics. And, Fitbit is my enabler.   However, my post-run tablet Fitbit app experience is different and more limited from the HTTPS-browser experience. App features, options, views, date-ranges vary between devices.  </p>

<p  >Security </p>
<p  >HTTPS-level <i>browser</i> security vs. iTunes &amp; Play Store native app security is akin to a vault door versus building door. I'm sorry, but there's a lot of difference!

<p class="firstparagraph">Next May 9th, the greatest known threat to traditional blockchain technology will be formally introduced, <i>along with its source code</i>, into our technological world. Hedera Hashgraph represents a blockchain alternative that caters to time-sensitive transactions, and order fairness. Currently, one transaction with Bitcoin takes about 12 minutes to validate. Ethereum is only a couple minutes, but in a world of micro-transactions and micro-second transactions, speed counts.</p><p>Next, Hedera's technology uses a consensus algorithm, which depends on  node neighbors' "voting" elections. This means that the design is impervious to "forking"--when a part of the blockchain splits and no long syncs with the main blockchain.  More importantly, Hedera's consensus design is   built on Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT), so is then impervious to threats of <i>Distributed Denial of Service (DDS) attacks. </i></p>
<p>So, lightning speed for validating crypto-transactions. Guaranteed security from hard- or soft-forking of the blockchain, and DDS-like attacks. Fairness in transaction order. Come May 9th, we'll see just how Hedera's codebase and cryptocurrency will accomplish these benchmarks, and if so, Heraclitean river stops in time! If not, yet another cryptographic mirage!</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber"><i>It's not about the Blockchain, the Efficient Network Data Distribution is the Answer!</i>
</h6>
<p class="firstparagraph">Last week and this week, the out-of-control handgun problem is in the news. This leads one to believe there is a problem with the <i>definition</i> of a gun. As always. Definitions start wars and world wars--after all of last century, did anyone decide who controls the Coal of Sudetenland?? You can bet everyone there speaks two languages, still. The <i>definitional </i> answer makes the answer: This is why Blockchain technology--straddled between myriad start-ups, countless institutions and a hundred brilliant minds is The answer to our scalability problems.   

</p><p>The problem is that data structures grow at differential rates, some exponential, some linear, some slower, some as a function of time or other variable.  Yet, our data analysis needs are clear: We need a new technology to handle quickly, securely and efficiently the <i>Networked, Relational Data Problem</i>, which scales exponentially with traditional data structures, like old-fashioned Excel-like Row-&amp;-Column data structures. Yet, as one would logarithmize the equation to best adapt new data, so must the computer data structure adjust accordingly. </p>
<p>Too rigid, the world turned to relational, non-Structured Query Language (SQL) data, partially for the need to dislate <i>data objects</i> from their tables. The world needed that cell as a free-radical in order to mimic the data structure of societally-networked society.  Alas, a science already at hard work with Cambridge Analytica--again what's that field of study called again, Sociology, right? </p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A.I. Part II: Problems with Scale, Kindly Resolved by A.I.
</h6>
<p class="firstparagraph">I mistakenly laid waste to A.I.'s reputation in my last post. It <i>did</i> let us, our whole society, let us down, and maybe the forensics will give us <i>a few excuses</i> down on the road. However, "homicide by A.I. (aka Uber)" will need to be updated in records. But, artificial intelligence is not at fault. There are a few software engineers that did the best they could--with the time their superiors gave them.  Uber leadership, let's hope, will be deterred from future carelessnes to come.   </p>

<p>That diatribe said, I do appreciate an Uber's proximity when I'm stranded at 2:00 am in a bad part of town. Why? Because I don't need to plan ahead -- Uber is there! And, sadly, I don't need to read or study -- Google is there! But wait, don't judge me, I'm not lazy! That being said, I have my own soul-searching to do: TECHNOLOGY AIDS AND ABETS ME AND MY ACTIONS, but it does not run my show> Only I take responsibility for my own actions: I allow technology into my life as a tool, and yet I   hold the power cord. I take responsibility for the tech that follows me--and believe me, I need that tech. And so do you. Not only so, but the world, and the ecological fate of our <i style="color:green">green earth</i>> also depends on tech, A.I. specifically. </p>
<p>
Humankind has already dug an ecological (dare I say 'alkaline') pit deeper than can be dug out of: Flooding, forest fires, and Species Extinctions. A.I. is <i style="color:brown"> is </i>> the only viable hope so we, i.e. Uber, shouldn't prematurely spoil its development. 
</p>
<p class="quote">Several questions raise their ugly head when A.I. can't help Earth or humankind. Like it or not, A.I. will need to 3-D print the dykes for the sunken coastal cities--like tiny island Den Haague, the most beautiful city in the world. Next, A.I. will make irrelevant fossil fuels by 2030, if not before; and those caught polluting would be fined to death, anyway. Without A.I., none of these worthwhile goals are possible. This precarious, difficult and most of all laborious job of designing our own solutions will take time: For this reason, Uber should be shamed even further for their short-cuts, and eventual errors of internal, organizational problems. <i>Uber's experiemental, tax-free "Testing Sandbox" cannot be the erstwhile safe neighborhoods of Surburban Phoenix, without proper caution.</i> </p>		
<p>Are Uber's corporate desires, market stronghold, and shareholders' delight more worthwhile than <i>an entire sensitive field of machine-learning research?</i> No. Uber must be warned to not steal corporate secrets from Waymo, then proceed to be 86'd from California, then brush aside with excuses the <i>killing of an innocent Arizona bicyclist</i>.</p>
<p>
Who can count the number of very feisty taxi-men and -women that are not fans of the infamously hasty culture of Uber. The team of lawyers needed to be 86'd from France? Uber already knows, because maybe they know B.D.O!

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">Hey Uber Driver, Please Slow Down!
</h6>
<p class="firstparagraph">A.I. generally, and specifically Uber's Self-Driving Tech, both have failed society this week. Although we could all debate the merits of "Lidar", i.e. laser-based vision, the primary concern, in my view, is Uber's obvious carelessness in rushing their self-driving tech.  Although six thousand (6,000 too many) pedestrians are killed in the U.S. annually, I'd only hope AI wouldn't add to the problem.<sup>2</sup> The Arizona victim was walking her bicycle when struck, and I as bike-commuter can't help but take the affair personally. </p>
<p>This first human death is at least a <strong>big Wake-Up moment</strong> for the industry in its haste to roll out A.I. tech.  After all, Uber's questionable leadership morals<sup>2</sup> and being kicked out of San Francisco for running more than six red-lights raises eyebrows to begin with.<sup>3</sup> My problem with Uber is that the car's algorithm, with perfect Lidar vision, did not flinch or slow down for two seconds as it killed the victim. Humans flinch and humans swerve, because protecting fellow humans is in our DNA, not in A.I.'s. So, while we now know Uber's software hasn't caught up with its A.I.-Lidar hardware--let's hope we see defensive driving and some <i>TLC</i> programmed into those A.I. Algorithms!

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Facebook Fiasco: Why Zuckerberg Should not have Dropped out of Harvard
</h6>
<p class="firstparagraph">
Universities, private or public institutions, serve as a beacon for
<strong>the Fearless Protection and Ethical Regulation</strong> of information and data. This is because data and data research
is innate to the university's Mission Statement, whereas business and governmental institutions are relatively new
to the game, and often at odds with the
<i>Academy</i>, and occasionally against each other. </p>
<p class="quote">Threats to student data privacy existed long before the internet. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover infiltrated Berkeley
student groups to counter communism in the 1960s. Around the same time, the CIA manipulated the National Student
Association for intelligence gathering in other anti-communism efforts. But the privacy issue is more acute now
that the amount of student data in cloud-based systems has grown exponentially and is more widely dispersed.
<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p> The University's expertise over ethically regulated data collection and management, is better than government, business,
and even medical domains for two reasons. First, the institution's long history and ethical motives with data are
unique. The norms of data-handling have been codified through the University's Institutional Review Board based
on its
<strong>stated mission</strong>. In other words, Universities take data seriously
<i>for reasons other than corporate profit or governmental control</i>. An example of personal data precautions has
played out with Harvard's recent data tiffs leading to the Supreme Court, illustrated by a 2016 article: </p>
<p class="quote">Last week undergraduates at Harvard University raised concerns about the institution handing over their data to an
anti-affirmative action group as part of a lawsuit. Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing the university
for allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants, will have access to “academic, extracurricular,
demographic and other information” from all undergrads who applied to Harvard between the fall 2009 and spring 2015,
omitting names and Social Security numbers.
<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>The second reason why Universities understand ethical implications for data is that data and more broadly data and
human information
<i>research</i> is the institutions' second highest priority, along with teaching and service. For example, in response
to the unethical Public Health research in
<i>Tuskegee Syphilis experiements</i>, the University instution
<i>stepped in</i> to help design the 1978
<strong>Belmont Principles</strong>. Currently, the University Institutional Review Board incorporates this with the Nuremburg
Code (developed after WWII NAZI research), in handling data research.
</p>
<p>In recent days,
<i>private companies</i> claim expertise for regulating "Fake News", and you guessed it,
<strong>regulation of data privacy &amp; confidentiality.</strong><sup>3</sup> The ethical authority over data privacy norms are nowhere
else than the University campus, case in point Harvard... Let the governments govern and the enterprises enterprise,
and leave the
<i>thoughtful, ethical regulation of data collection and precaution </i> to the Ivory Tower. Corporate and Government
self-regulation is opaque enough!</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A New Politics of Power:
<br /> The Cryptographic Financial Escape Hatch
</h6>
<p>I had originally intended for a post on the very lamentable
<i>Blockbuster-ization</i> and eventual demise of Toys-"R"-Us, but Tech Affairs happen too quickly! Instead ...</p>
<p class="firstparagraph">Today, US inserted itself into a large, deep debate about crypto-legitimacy by imposing new sanctions on Venezuela.
In case you hadn't heard, here's a quick recap:</p>
<p class="quote">The administration’s announcement came a few hours after Mr. Trump signed an executive order barring the use of any
digital currency issued by the Maduro government since Jan. 9. Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country
had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation’s vast petroleum reserves.
<br />
<br />The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation
of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation.
<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
This turn of events, both Maduro et al.'s financial cleverness and Trump's action to de-legitimate the Petro crypto-currency,
are examples of the undefined, near-limitless political uses for Blockchain Tech, both offensively and defensively.
In fact, the ensuing events may be of great interest as we will witness a major first actual use-case of the decentralizing
aims of crypto-technology tool. A tool that softens the financial leverage wielded by centralized authorities, whether
governemntal or private.
</p>
<p>I used the term "de-legitimate" above because there are two processes at work: First, crypto-currencies are
<i>in themselves</i> not legitimate. A
<strong>crypto-currency platform gains legitimacy through a series of both technical and financial trust-building stages</strong>.
So legitimacy is earned first privately, and some currency platforms continue publicly to Initial Coin Offering,
and so on--purely financial and technical legitimacy.
</p>
<p>And then, there is the another kind of legitimacy, which involves political leverage ... </p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come, Part II: A Ripple and an Iota of Sustainable Crypto-Currency
</h6>
<p class="firstparagraph">Iota and Ripple cryptocurrencies use different technology than traditional blockchain in order to achieve their distributed
ledgers. Traditionally, outside "miners" validate the block's
<i> transaction records</i> as it replicates to the next "block." For example, a transaction is validated 2 or three
times, and since three miners' validations all agree, one is kept and two are destroyed, in a nutshell; one example
of computations (
<strong>and hence coal</strong>) that cost too much time and energy.</p>
<p>Unlike this arrangement, Iota, Ripple, and Hedera use a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) data structure (shaped like
a sideways genealogy tree) that relies on "consensus" from its nearest neighbor transaction nodes.
<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>Enough with the jargon! The bottom line is that Bitcoin's tech is not eco-sustainable,
<sup>2</sup> and so alternatives are already closing in on Bitcoin. Iota, the 8th largest cryptocurrency Iota delivers
open-source transparency, lightning speed, and yet is it cryptographically sound? Not according to some tech pundits:
</p>
<p class="quote">You might think that IOTA, a cryptocurrency worth over a billion dollars, and working with organizations like Microsoft,
University College London, Innogy, and Bosch, BNY Mellon, Cisco, and Foxconn (through the Trusted IOT Alliance)
would not have fairly obvious vulnerabilities, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. When we took a look at their
system, we found a serious vulnerability and textbook insecure code.
<br />
<br /> “In 2017, leaving your crypto algorithm vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis is a rookie mistake. It says that
no one of any calibre analyzed their system, and that the odds that their fix makes the system secure is low,” states
Bruce Schneier, renowned security technologist, about IOTA when we shared our attack.
<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>And so, with a 1.9 billion market cap, I sometimes have to reflect on the immensity and non-relational fact and figures
of our technological world! Security and other bugs are hard to avoid when an industry is moving too fast for thoroughly
tested betas; and each iteration involves a series of bug-patches, with short- and long-term priorities stretched
with new design &amp; function trade-offs.</p>
<p>
Full life-cycle software development, from napkin-idea to rolling specs, always follows these patterns yet not always with
so much money on the line! Here's a closer look at one critique of Iota:</p>
<p class="quote">
IOTA developers had written their own hash function, it was a huge red flag ... I think it’s important to reiterate that
the IOTA developers do not agree with our characterization of this as an issue of concern. Our report lays out more
details about why we are concerned.
<br />
<br /> There are other red flags — unlike every other program running on your laptop or phone, IOTA uses ternary instead
of binary. Since all computer hardware today uses binary, IOTA converts to ternary in software, which is less efficient
and more complex. This complexity prevents IOTA from benefiting from existing security analysis tools that are designed
to work with binary, and makes the code harder to read and understand.
<br />
<br /> The current IOTA tangle requires a trusted party (the coordinator) for security, suggesting that in its current
form it’s not ready to run as a truly permissionless, decentralized system.
<sup>3</sup>
</p><p>
Optimizing, not sacrificing, should be the name of the game as Tech closes in on Blockchain challenges of security, scalability,
and that evers-so-costly
<strong>Sustainability!</strong>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come
</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Sustainability for the environment means an accelerated transition to renewables. While other nations have undertaken
big steps toward wind and solar - even China's pollution declined in 2014 for the first time
<sup>1</sup>. EU is now 30% renewable--from 12% in 2000 to expected 50% renewable energy by 2030
<sup>2</sup>. Us, it appears, not so much...ouch.</p>
<p>What can we do then, in our lives, to make our own contribution. Well, besides less fossil fuels and red meat, we
can choose our cryptocurrencies more conscientiously. One NY town's recent actions echo my own concerns about the
enormous carbon footprint of "Proof-of-Work" blockchain mining.
</p>
<p class="quote">
The city of Plattsburgh has put a moratorium on cryptocurrency mining to preserve natural resources, the health of its residents
and the city’s “character and direction,” officials said after a public hearing Thursday. For 18 months, the 20,000-resident
city will not consider new applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining. Violators will face fines of up to
$1,000 for each day they defy the moratorium.
<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>So, me too - count me out, I can't help but do the same, and pronounce my own refrain from Bitcoin (this is more
spiritual since I don't own, nor mine). In contrast, I'll put Ethereum on hold since they are transitioning to a
zero carbon-footprint by year's end. </p>
<p>And, for the most environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies, I wholly support Ripple (3rd highest valued cryptocurrency)
and also clean
<i>Iota</i> (8th highest valued )
<sup>5</sup>. Ripple, unfortunately, is a private company with a less-accessible internal distributed ledger. And yet,
Hedera Hashgraph heralds the most optimistic news of all: A blindlingly fast Hashgraph structure, unbound from any
carbon footprint.

<strong>Creators in the Digital Age</strong>, especially Musicians, have faced just a panoply of business model challenges,
notably since the 2000s'
<i>Napster Era</i>. And yet, this is the age-old-case of new technologies reshaping long-standing fields, especially
financial structure - the bottom line! All creative fields also have technological features on the horizon that
may, potentially move the playing field. First some recent background: </p>
<p class="quote">
While [Taylor Swift] is certainly making money in retail sales and digital downloads, both of those metrics are spiraling
downward as people migrate away from the concept of owning music at all. Nielsen recently released numbers indicating
substantial drops in both CD and digital-track sales, which are down almost $100 million
<i>year over year</i> from 2014; streaming music continues to grow, but the revenue it generates isn’t close to making
up the difference, yet.
<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>Most remember Taylor Swift's 2014 industry-shaking album withdraw in protest to Spotify's payment structure. The
next year Taylor took on Apple iTunes--to which Apple bended to Taylor's Way
<sup>2</sup>. These wins are amazing but not enough, if only for winning battles in a losing war. </p>
<p class="quote">Spotify is the future. Spotify is the enemy. Spotify doesn’t pay enough. Spotify is music’s best bet for revenue
growth. Since it arrived in the United States from Sweden in 2011, Spotify has been cast as both hero and villain
in the music industry’s continuing debate over streaming music. </p>
<p class="quote">
It has been hailed as a potential savior through a two-tiered “freemium” model that would gradually lure listeners away from
piracy. Yet Spotify’s royalty rates have also terrified many artists already worried that each new step in music’s
digital evolution further devalues their work.
<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>So the trend looks dire, and yet is it really? Where, just where are the
<strong>Tech Platforms </strong> leading us? Tech is leading us
<i>nowhere</i>, at least not to one
<strong>singular, centralized place</strong>; rather, decentralized tech--including but not limited to blockchain--is busy
rewriting the boundaries between creators and consumers. This Tuesday's Forbes article reported on new subscription-based
model by Patreon. Still classical Web 2.0, it's novelty appears so simple, almost intuitive in potentially new pathway:</p>
<p class="quote">"On Kickstarter and Indiegogo, creators essentially have to start over every time," says Danny Rimer, a partner at
Index Ventures who is a Patreon investor and board member. "It's the same reason software companies went from licensed
software to subscriptions: predictable revenue and better service for customers."
<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>
Apparently Patreon, along with last November's
<i>Drip</i> by KickStarter have made headway. Patreon paid out $150 million to its artists in 2017, and each are doubling
annually. Decentralizing again. Well, we say we can't
<i>go back to the way it was</i>, but Tech always seems to lead us back to the way it was!

<br />Strength of the People</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Today's demonstrations and walk-outs, led by America's Youth and followed by many of the education staff, has aimed
directly at Gun-Control legislation. Yet, the message more powerfully articulated than ever by adolescent-turns-adult
students, takes aim at something further afield. </p>
<p>Students, remembering the February 14th massacre victims, take aim at the corruption stemming from the 2010 Supreme
Court "Person-hood" protection for Corporations, also known as the
<i>Citizens United</i> Decision. A dated, but poignant, article from National Public Radio explains:
</p>
<p class="quote">The Supreme Court extended that protection to corporations, and over time also extended some — but not all — of the
rights guaranteed to individuals in the Bill of Rights.
<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
Yet, it appears deceptively harmless for Congressional Law-makers to protect corporations, in the form of
<strong>Gun Manufacturers' Lobbyists, </strong>
as equally as it protects humans. The origin or this ruling dates to a 70's Neo-Liberal, right-leaning legislation and Court
rulings that include a pivotal 1978
<i>First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti</i> decision allowing for corporations' ballot-initiative campaign contributions,
citing the First Amendment.
<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>

The Result? The corporation, in "person" form, takes on Pseudo-Human qualities: immortal, beyond-measure capital, and programmatically
serving stock-holders' interests with cut-throat competition at all costs. No match against a sympathetic human,
yet the Corporation is given the same rights and privileges as the man in the street. Now, in the face of two decades'
dead humans--as young as
<i>Sandy Hook Elementary</i>, which were not protected by Legislation, due to commitments made to corporate lobbying.
</p>
<p>It appears increasingly difficult for Marco Rubio to accept money from gun lobbyists
<i>in exchange</i> for executing their legislation demands. As I mentioned in my
<a href="#18-02-14">February 14th post</a> on the topic, it is clear a generation is awakening: And, the Humans have begun to revolt
against the
<strong>Heavily-Armed Lobbying Machines!

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:
<br /> Part III and Sustainability of Shared, Distributed Ledger Types</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">March 13th, 2018 marks the day that certain types of blockchain technologies, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, face
an existential crisis: Today, a new distributed ledger technology has been announced, which departs from the traditional
"Proof-of-Work" (energy-intensive calculations) Blockchain technologies. This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint.
For example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore's 49.8!</p>
<p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to
<i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking:
Denial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot),
so the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle. </p>
<p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly,
this is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950's (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating
system. </p>
<p>
Next, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of "fairness" because blockchain transactions are
<i>
<strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i> Bitcoin transactions are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle,
which is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p>
<p>
Swirld's unveiled their consensus-based
<strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has now been announced to
deploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news! Tremendous, since I explained
in my
<a href="#18-03-01">March 1st </a> blog post that older blockchain technologies incentivize miners' efforts by directly tying electrical-cost(
(in calculations) to the Bitcoin/hour profit margin. For this reason, the future horizon just considerably shortened
Bitcoin's runway for establishing anything beyond "early-adopter" status. </p>
<p>So, we'll see if the innovating crew with Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum can successfully alter the crypto algorithm
into it's planned carbon-free consensus-based, "proof-of-stake" form. For the moment, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other
electricity-draining "proof-of-work" designs, have their
<strong>exchange value trapped inside their own Carbon Footprint</strong>.
<sup>4</sup> And so, because environmental sustainablity is foremost of concerns for future investment, survival may
depend on digging out of that Carbon Footprint much more quickly!</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:
<br /> Part II and New Forms of Trust</h6>
<p class="firstparagraph">
Throughout the centralized-tech period of the
<i>mobile-powered </i> Web 2.0, most Sharing transactions take place on a centralized platform that simply facilitates
the peer-to-peer transactions. However, the trust is based on some third-party authority. For instance, Uber serves
as the centralalized, third-party authority between both consumers (whether resource-obtaining or resource-providing)
must place their trust. Similarly, centralized authorities like Paypal, etc. enable peer-to-peer collaboration.
Yet, the notion of trust remains unsolved: Both parties must place their faith in the third party. By definition,
this problem that undermines the
<i>Sharing Economy</i> is resolved by Blockchain technologies, through cryptography. Now, Decentralized Apps (DAPPS)
provide a truer sharing platform for value transactions.
</p>
<p>In short, neither peer,
<strong>neither consumer needs to be trusted, because both parties share a mutual trust in their shared ledger</strong>
(think of a thick book with an indexed log of each and every transaction, with unchangeable entries etched by cryptography.
In this fashion the forms of Exchange Value include:
<br /> 1. Value Funds &amp; Investments
<br /> 2. Immutable Insurance &amp; Risk Management
<br /> 3. Account for &amp; Audit Commodified Value 4. Authenticate &amp; Attest to Value
<br /> 5. Transfer, Store, Lend Value

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:
<br /> Part I and the Race for Sustainability Solutions</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Sharing can be a philosophy and even an ideology, but it is also
<strong> a concept sewn into the Technology of the Era</strong>. Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer
marketplaces,
<i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer
of resources. By either sense, the
<i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media,
internet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s
<i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods
and services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>

<p>In
<i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how
the
<strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>.
<sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3) breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general
purpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power,
sources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>

<p>The first condition: New forms of communication to
<i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second
condition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition:
New methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving
solar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated,
driverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new
technology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>

<p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s
innovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in
the present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively
the New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>

<p>So, how can we change the way we
<i>think</i> and how we
<i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on
<strong>
<i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i>
</strong>
<sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will
a New Paradigm Shift emerge. In this occasion however, we as a society may not have the luxury of decades to adapt
to New Technologies, as the carbon hangover from the previous Industrial Era imperils the safe arrival of the next!</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">1.4 Million Reasons for More Women in Tech, Part II
<br />
<br /> * Continuation of Women in Tech Theme from
<a href="#18-02-23">Feb. 23rd Blog</a>
</h6>

<p class="quote">This is the first time in human history that we have the ability to see enough about ourselves that we can hope to
actually build social systems that work qualitatively better than the systems we&#39;ve always had.</p>

<p class="quote">--Author unknown</p>

<p class="firstparagraph">My February 23rd Post on women in tech focused on the
<i>workforce demand</i> for more women in tech positions, however today I&#39;m writing on the
<strong>
<i>social need</i> for more female insight within the tech workforce</strong> , given that programming will increasingly
shape our future institutions. This means that every institution, whether private hospitals, non-profit charity
foundations, or government bureaus, will effectively restructure (optimize) their own organizational structure in
an increasingly
<i>data-driven</i> paradigm. From a Sociology of Organizations perspective, the changes to come are breath-taking to
consider.</p>

<p>So why women? Where could I start? Better stated, why is a quintessentially important job sector, a sector in desperate
need for insight, comprised primarily of men?
<sup id="one">1</sup> The facts are evident: ~15-20% of women comprising tech positions.
<sup id="two">2</sup> Numbers aside, I argue there is a quintessential societal need for more women in tech: This is because computing
and understanding data has changed since the data collection from Web 2.0 (mobile), becoming more networked and
relational.</p>

<p>The challenge for society in this age is historic, and women must absolutely be included in the process of the age:
Please consider, that in the 1650&#39;s, the invention of the microscope opened a new world of data and
<i>information</i> about the bacteriological, microscopic surroundings--hitherto blind to all. Likewise, the telescope
has allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>

<p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage)
a universe of knowledge--about
<i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the
data to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the
<i>output</i> can be
<i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the
key challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>

<p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables. This is akin
to finding a needle in an increasingly complex and growing haystack.</p>

<p class="quote">What&#39;s different now and has changed is it&#39;s no longer about taking this data, putting it into a computer
running a calculation and getting a balance sheet answer ...</p>

<p class="quote">What&#39;s important now is what is the context of the data, what is it connected to, what effect is it having on
data around it... It&#39;s basically a network of the data, it&#39;s no longer sort of tabular columns, of rows
of data, it&#39;s
<i>interconnected patterns</i>.
<br /> --Tim Cook</p>

<p>This quote means that as we move away from rule-based, mechanistic data analytics toward more complex, relational
and networked data, we need an equally complex paradigm to keep up. Excluding the female mind from this challenge
is not simply a clumsy, myopic mistake. Worse yet, so long as the Tech Industry remains gender lop-sided, Tech will
increasingly resemble another myopic beast, a cave-dweller named Cyclops.</p>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">April 23 Implementation of the FCC Net Neutrality Laws:
<br /> The Coming Battle of States&#39; versus Federal Rights</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Net Neutrality Rules, potentially one of the more important set of Individual Rights for us as citizens in the tech
age, will soon undergo the rule changes voted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) this past December.
In a nutshell, the Internet Service Providers (ISP&#39;s), e.g. Comcast, Cox, Verizon are granted the power--as
a Title I &quot;information service&quot;--to slow down traffic, make fast- &amp; slow-lanes. Of course this is
bad news for internet-users because even premium users may experience &quot;throttling&quot; if using the ISP&#39;s
preferred apps. The only stipulation holds that the ISP&#39;s rules are made public. However, 21 states are bringing
lawsuits to fight these changes, and the first assertion of State Law by Washington State today:</p>

<p class="quote">The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback of net neutrality rules, including
an effort from 21 state attorneys general to get a court to block the FCC&#39;s move.</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;This is symbolic politics, because the states know it is illegal to do,&quot; Roslyn Layton, a visiting scholar
at the American Enterprise Institute, told NBC News. &quot;But they can put rules on the book and make it look like
they&#39;re doing something.&quot; The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback

<h6 class="chapternumber">March 5, 2018</h6>

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel: Part II and the Germs</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Germs present a timely topic for today, given the especially virulent
<strong>Flu Virus strain</strong>. Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era
<sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any
medical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39;
surface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively,
and provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics
are
<i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>

<p class="quote">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating
strains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies
relied on a misleading methodology.</p>

<p class="quote">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations
in the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which
manufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while
it is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains.
<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu
virus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu
<i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with
<i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>

<p class="quote">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses
that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that
are pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic
tree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system
exposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond
<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular
period each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal
time-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>

<p class="quote">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further
away on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses.
<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a
<i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also
provides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain
math can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort
of.</p>

<p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each
other, then conditional upon other factors. This being
<i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e
things: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any
<i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions
about a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>

<p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our
sciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The
first of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of
which gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>

<p>
The third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating
<i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better
handle on the multiple effects of
<sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large
Numbers
<sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new
<strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the
<i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician
out there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!

<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Back in 1997, a Pulitzer-Prize winning theory--based on Dr. Jared Diamond&#39;s
<i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies</i> --provided the recipe book for the success of societies.
Not without controversy, the theory posits that geographic and environmental preconditions, once met, provide tech
&amp; resources trading opportunities, within a network of other nation-states also vying for technogical innovation.</p>

<p>A nation&#39;s Technology, in turn, opens the means necessary to expansive, stable, independent sovereignty that
lasts and thrives. Equally so, the nation&#39;s friends, especially those making the best-friends list, share and
receive a secondary, &quot;residual&quot; technological bump over the time-course of the network&#39;s future trading,
i.e. network transactions. So, if our best friends Canada and Mexico are less keen, then there is network reverberation!</p>

<p>Given the advent of a real, lasting Trade-War, I would think that a network theorist wouldn&#39;t be betting on one
particular node within this network. I say this because a disproportionately asymmetrical flow of technology and
resources, while simultaneously raising prices on most staple goods, may spell trouble for the Every-Day person.
So far, Nation-State: 0, People: 0 ... So, who wins with a Trade War? Alas, let&#39;s hope not the resurrection
of the Neo-Multi-National Corporations, born from NAFTA deals, coincidentally, from the late 1990&#39;s. Bah humbug!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Widening Circles of Mobile-App Security Risks</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Security, security, another day another platform risk, or risks from your device, or risks from transactions, Today&#39;s
headline buried beneath a techy jargon provides a glimpse of the rising threat of web-application-based hackery:
Cryptojacking.
<i>Coindesk</i> reports, &quot; Opera browser introduces cryptocurrency miner protection for smartphones ... &quot;</p>

<p class="quote">Cryptocurrency miners can overload smartphones&#39; CPUs, forcing 100 percent usage and potentially causing a phone
to overheat. And the damage can sometimes be permanent. According to a ZDNet article, one trojan generated so much
heat in a phone, its battery became swollen, permanently damaging the phone. While excessive ads were one reason
for the heat generation, the main cause was that the phone&#39;s CPU was hijacked to mine for Monero.
<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>The larger issue here is that the lines between trusted mobile-app authorities, i.e., certified by Play Store or
Apple&#39;s is increasingly irrelevent. This is because an increasing number of app-users are ditching device-downloaded
apps, preferring for browser applications--hence, a much more appetizing market for the newest generation of blackhat
hackers, online thieves, peeping-toms, and other ill-wishers. There are a few driving factors for this issue--one
of which is the onset of Decentralized Applications (DAPPs), which use the
<i>browser</i> to interface between the Every-Day blockchain client/merchant/programmer and the actual byte-code of
the blockchain (via WEB).</p>

<p>More importantly, the larger issue is that we live in an age in which the exclusive, native browser language since
1995, i.e. JavaScript. Security issues with browser-based apps were very low, because JavaScript never left the
browser, ever. Until 2009, Data, Servers were the domain of PHP, JAVA, Python, etc. or some other language for the
highly sensitive, dirty work of dipping into all that data sitting ontop of centralized servers around the world.
PHP wasn&#39;t easy, so power and responsibility usually followed with all the extra effort and expertise.</p>

<p>2015 augured in the Node.js server-accessing (can create, read, update, and delete date) new-born capabilities of
JavaScript</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Blockchain Sustainability Issues and The Double-Edged Sword</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">I couldn&#39;t help but revisit the
<strong>Environmental Sustainability</strong> problem I addressed in my February 28th post. This problem, experienced by
the top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the
<i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the
<i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity KiloWatt Hours
per year.
<sup>1</sup> Digiconomist succinctly writes:</p>

<p class="quote">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a
solid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years
this has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of
the currency reached new highs.
<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>And, so the issue I&#39;m addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more
equipment, and in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin&#39;s surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year
usage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per year, respectively.
In other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner&#39;s cost (in electricity) compared with the miner&#39;s gain (in
Bitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper Carbon Footprint.</p>


<p class="quote">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin network has
been increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start of November 2017, the Bitcoin
Energy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network to be half of the
current amount. On the first day of November, the estimated consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year.
<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>
Carbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner&#39;s electricity costs account for approximately
65% of the profit (Bitcoin units&#39; value, measured when mined). So the
<i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost
of the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the
<i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then
perhaps the other edge looks preferred!

<h5 class="subdailytech bc">Musing Blockchain</h5>



<p class="author">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>



<h6 class="chapternumber">Feb 10, 2018</h6>



<h6>First Blog Post!</h6>



<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Why are Sociologists now the Key Players in Data Analysis within the Domain of Blockchain Technologies?</h6>



<p class="firstparagraph">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin and other

cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology (peer-to-peer global

ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate, individual needs and uses.

These blockchain &quot;network&quot; analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network changes, node

changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly or not.</p>



<p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships) that

include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain tech must face analytical

challenges that arise from informal practices

<sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role&#39;s protocol for

the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>



<p>Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan&#39;s (1977)

<i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple

<i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time, convenience,

etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm human understanding

<i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of a bank, a person,

or a company&#39;s internal bot?</p>



<p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought the

world the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can not contribute everything, especially relating with social

needs and uses. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the multi-dimensional layers

of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks? Well enough to differentiate qualitative

meaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.</p>



<p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved, integrated

through multiple layers of &quot;middlemen&quot;, such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions, non-governmental,

non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases the middlemen. Suddenly, one

programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team

of hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing.</p>



<p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the life of

the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years&#39; Sociology Network Analysts&#39;

research and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and should not turn to the

Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already at home, safe within the academic

domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology

can either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances, accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises.

Or, the next ten years can follow Sociology&#39;s Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful

future.</p>



<p>Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on

review of the Sociologists&#39; specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships,

within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships.

We Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized

by fixed patterns.</p>



<p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes that characterize

societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large Number Statistical Theory

become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900&#39;s Sociological French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach&#39;s

work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society&#39;s Collective Memory.</p>



<p>No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic&#39;s &quot;irrational

behaviors&quot; and Mathematical &quot;complexity models&quot; do not

<i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate simultaneous

node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups

get jobs), and most importantly the

<i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time and fixed.</p>



<p>Fine. So, why is Sociology&#39;s network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th and

20th centuries&#39; network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era, while North

American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960&#39;s [post-1968], U.S. in the 1990&#39;s[post-1999],

in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of past sociology are inherently small-data and

more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates &quot;human-ness&quot; into the billion rows and

columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>



<p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation

for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of each relationship

(link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is

possible to isolate directional, conditional

<i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation

<sup id="9one">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on social networks.</p>



<p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person

<i>self-selects </i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group&#39;s

behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group&#39;s behavior,

by the group&#39;s influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder&#39;s SIENA software, achieves

the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology. The network graph

can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not

as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes

(social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount

of missing data</p>



<p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear, directed

path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists are called upon,

blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again the same bugs. Sadly, this

semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain for their currency, contract,

and other societal needs--in this case, the blind would indeed lead the blind.</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber">Feb 11, 2018</h6>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">How Can We Best Modularize our App Designs in Order to Achieve the Much Vaunted &quot;Separation of Concerns&quot;?</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed Order of
Coders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from structural design.
Hence, in the early 2000&#39;s, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to abide by The scaffolding
of HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we must throw out this antiquated division
of labor within web coding.</p>

<p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules and components
Must hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled html, js, css, it is now requisite
to divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and
<i>
each</i> of these component teams
<strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module&#39;s required html, js, css.</p>

<p>This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and
all coding will necessarily begin to &#39;reinvent the wheel.&#39; This is because any module, any library you go
to, will
<i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate new
css from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual misery, almost
instantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>

<p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher level of abstraction,
leaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice in the modern world, and if
ad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity? If yesterday&#39;s craft was the
hoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part
by part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and
pastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module
definition? That&#39;s absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules.</p>

<p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an age that
each year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic sugar and also fundamental
structure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us
to a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the &quot;Separation of Concerns.&quot; We can allow ourselves
a break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must
<i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s Innocence</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Facebook Scandals
<sup>1</sup> of recent months have demoralized the leadership for a role of misinformation in the Tech Age, however I
charge Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s innocence
<i>not</i> because all of us, as a society, were equally warned. Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created abnormal,
never-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were so efficient at multiplying
and exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social
learning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own control.</p>

<p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial
<sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation were
not entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural changes from
higher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in their content and influence)
begin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes
dominated by the relationships, e.g., the &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;shares&quot;, leading to a statistically natural
propensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel
to the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal
and tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary
<i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>

<p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual &quot;interruptions&quot; that
previously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains:</p>

<p class="quote">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication that the
timespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation Bias, misinformation
and outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that are already hard to change.</p>

<p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,
<i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network phenomonenon--ultimately
driven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry, conditional influences, and
the strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these factors, our social inclinations were
<i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were!</p>

<p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network phenomena
-- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!</p>

<sup>1</sup> of Hippocrates:
<br /> On the 2015 Social Sciences Modification to the AAMC Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT)</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Other than college pre-med students, few know the MCAT exam--the gatekeeper of U.S. &amp; Canadian Medical Schools--underwent
a major modification in 2015.
<sup>2</sup> Much deeper than Biological and Technological updates, major sections were added and/or expanded including
the Social, Pyschological and Biological foundations of
<i>behavior</i>. Named the
<i>Health Systems Science</i>
<sup>3</sup>, the American Medical Association&#39;s modern, holistic approach articulates outcomes-based measures for
healthy living and disease prevention efforts. You could say the AMA is indeed,
<i>woke</i>.</p>

<p>But really, what&#39;s the difference and why would we care? And, who doesn&#39;t know that an apple-a-day keeps
the doctor away? Dr. Jeffrey Borkan, MD, PHD of Brown University&#39;s Warren Alpert Medical School, explains the
evident role of all those unnoticed social interactions involved in obtaining and consuming that apple. Further,
the spatial and economic
<i>availability</i> of that apple also plays a role in keeping the doctor away. Borkan explains:</p>

<p class="quote">It&#39;s time for us to take a leap forward in educating physicians for the health care delivery models of the future&mdash;those
that aim to improve not just the health of the individual patient and their family, but also the community and the
population.
<sup>4</sup>
</p>

<p>What, then, specifically, are the mechanisms that a community network&#39;s aggregated health may be inextricably
tied up with
<i>our own</i> individual health? In short, they are the sharing of health-promoting resources, timely assistance,
health-promoting information channels -- all this, among the countless perks of a healthy social circle!</p>

</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph" style="color:green;">Given that a community network&#39;s aggregated health is inextricably, and symmetrically, tied up with
<i>our own</i> individual health, app-developers may design activity- and communication-based apps more responsibly,
and in touch with modern healthcare recommendations. After all, if the Saintly Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s communication-
and activity-based app inadvertantly led to novel, and deeply consequential, effects, then ...</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">A New Kernel, and the Manifestation of a Two-Hundred Year Problem named
<i>Anomie</i>
</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Given the tragic events at a Florida school over Valentine&#39;s Day, 2018, who can write about Fitbits? So, thoughts
and sympathy for those students today that endured this horror. 19 years after the first-of-its-kind school shooting,
we as an American society have not become &#39;numb&#39; to these events. It hurts as much as it did in 1999.</p>

<p>Darn that innocuous Spring day in 1999, when we heard the most absurd news-- students attacked their own colleagues
at Colombine? In my blog post from January 10, I wrote that American Sociology, along with Qu&eacute;bec, came of
age much later than European Sociology. The past 50 years&#39; social changes and new problems are generally atrributed
for the increasing demand for sociological expertise after 1999, after a singular, senseless tragedy of a school
shooting--this event, like a small kernel of societal desperation for a solution--led to a flurry of self-professed
sociologists &agrave; la Michael Moore&#39;s Colombine, and other social-responsibility themed social consciousness.
So far, only mutually incompatible solutions. The problem, however, is not new, only the manifestation of it.</p>

<p>Suicide rates in 19th century France, disproportionately high, also served as a symptomatic manifestation of the
same problem, called
<i>Anomie.</i>
<sup>1</sup> The term,
<i>Anomie</i>, coined by Emile Durkheim in the late 1800&#39;s, captured the sense of instability, cultural and moral
relativism that undermined a shared sense of meaning. Suicides, week-after-week, month-after-month? In 1897 France,
noone had ever seen it before--at such rates--and people wanted answers. Alas, a kernel of social desperation leading
to inquiry.</p>

<p>People wanted to know why so many in the population responded negatively to the rapid changes, urbanization (Dreadful
factory conditions &agrave; la
<i>Taylorism&#39;s</i> calculated efficiency) new technologies, i.e. electricity, railroads, steam engines; these created
an arbitrarily new world, very suddenly. Suddenly, like trying for the first time a roller-coaster, when all you&#39;ve
ever known has been the carousel. So, we see technology&#39;s role for well or for ill, our job is to understand
how to dial-in the tech specs necessary to keep society smiling on this roller coaster through another, yet not
altogether new, technological thrill-ride.</p>

<a href="#18-02-17"> three-part blog series in my Feb. 17-20 posts</a> on the micro-economic horizon of blockchain technologies.</abbr>
</small>
</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Has anyone else been underwhelmed by the lack of Bitcoin&#39;s daily
<i>presence</i>, despite its everpresence at the dinner tables and caf&eacute;s across America. Sure, it&#39;s more
of a &quot;metropolitan&quot; phenomenon; and sure, it&#39;s become an accepted global platform--along with myriad
other crypto-currencies, but it&#39;s exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies
are useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency&#39;s rise to
fame with last year&#39;s increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its contributions,
uses, fame are one-sidedly
<i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article
<sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of
<i>actual</i> use at the &quot;cash-registers&quot; of society.</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological
<i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Rogers&#39;
<i>Diffusion of Innovations</i>
<sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger&#39;s bell curve
ranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However, the blockchain
articles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine usefulness for the
every-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>

<p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is
<i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific information--whether
financial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order before I continue, since we can
all relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most notably concerning Target store credit card
hacks a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions,
this person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction:
they prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that $27, $200,
or $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their
<i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and if the store&#39;s
databases are hacked, then tough-luck!</p>

<p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for each transaction,
providing the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient! Nobody thinks to walk around
with their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit
card system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions
have had to rely on the many layers of security, passwords, pins, mothers&#39; maiden names, etc. Then, based on
the mathematics behind prime numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright
red target on it.</p>

<p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And that, my
friends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency, instead
the crypto-
<i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero&#39;s name
is the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide pinpointed,
<i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for the sake of
renting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don&#39;t need this. They need
to know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire governmental database of information
about you!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Tech on the Regret: Unintended, secondary effects of communication- and activity-based app-designs</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Given that our app-use is inextricably tied up with our own behavior, activity/communication-based app developers
have in the past year accepted (mostly in word) a renewed responsibility. More like resposibility for a multi-faceted
power of influence granted to an industry, suddenly, disproportionately great, and
<i>semi-arbitrarily related</i> to the designer&#39;s intent (and control!). After all, if the Saintly Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s
activity/communication-based app inadvertantly led to novel, and deeply consequential, effects, then anyone could.</p>

<p>After all, who could guess
<i>how</i> these app-design effects would affect the users, years later. Who do we think programmers are, sociologists?
More specifically, who could know
<i>which</i> mundane coding practices, arbitrary app-design--like sharing permissions/features? Sure, everyone deep
down knew their company practices yield unfathomable power of influence over the daily habits of cell-users, a.k.a.
everyone. The easy part is knowing; the hard part is learning how and why certain app-features lead to behavioral
risks.</p>

<p>There could be no better example than the Alcoholic faced with an intervention by a loving family longing for change.
The alcoholic could be forgiven for past misdeeds, but without actual
<i>Acknowledgement</i> of a crisis in direction, which necessitates professional help from social scientists. Therefore,
the recent
<i>acknowledgments</i> signify something deeper--they signify a humility that app-designers are not sociologists, generally
speaking. So, that means hiring sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists for every N
<small>th</small> app-coder and software engineer. History can&#39;t be rewritten, but it can be interpreted and learned
from. The acknowledgment is itself a victory if it induces learning from the raw, social sciences, whose expertise
<i>can</i> predict how or why certain &quot;life&quot;-features, practices, and policies often unfold with undue and
unintended social consequences.</p>

<p>Water under the bridge, but going forward, it is one thing to claim a &quot;renewed sense of remorse&quot;, another
to acknowledge, learn and change. Like last November
<sup>1</sup> when Facebook co-founder Sean Parker confessed certain designs like &quot;social-validation feedback loop&quot;
and other app-design intentions, while ignoring potential secondary effects on society. So, the
<i>Acknowledgment</i> is the big win here--not so much the remorse!</p>

<a href="#18-02-15"> February 15th blog post</a>
</abbr> on the micro-economic horizon of blockchain technologies. </small>
</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">7 Ethereum-based technological features offer us a new world -- a decentralized new world, not dependent on the centralized
servers of Instagram, Comcast, T-Mobile, Amazon, etc. With that statement ends general consensus among blockchain
experts, pundits, and authors. However, if the current logistical obstacles provide controversy and competing algorithms
over sustainability, security, and scalability, then they reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses
(and potential effects) than they hide. In my February 15th
<a href="#18-02-15">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects of the
crypto-contract horizon.</p>

<p>
<strong>Prologue</strong>
</p>

<p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the
<i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals? First, a
little background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum blockchain helps distinguish
itself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech, like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based
blockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming features, e.g. &quot;looping&quot;, &quot;recursion&quot;,
with the full power of a
<i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable problem.</p>

<p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the accounting
system of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction, An Ethereum
blockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,
<i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks to calculate
into a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>

<p>Therefore, Ethereum&#39;s Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum
blockchain is actually a &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, like a a big networked &quot;home computer&quot;. The native
language of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an
<i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home computer,
then directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman&#39;s terms, the manner that modern-day app,
for example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one programming system
to interact with another, such as Instragram offers a &quot;sharing API&quot; that connects to hardware contacts,
thus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook
account, via your T-Mobile phone&#39;s contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we
live in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system,
which exchanges API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier.</p>

<p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity
days; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise. The reason
being that digital math uses binary &quot;on/off&quot; calculations, while quantum math implicates a tertiary,
<i>qubit</i> &quot;simultaneous states&quot;. Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology,
both programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA&#39;s blockchain
design utilizes a
<i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one&#39;s transaction is entered into with a private-key, and the blockchain
moreso resembles a &quot;Tangle&quot; of a directed graph, which allows for computational &quot;states&quot;. IOTA
recently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent vulnerability.
In truth, this was a case of user-error because users were
<i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer could
crack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough now to cause
damage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum possibilities.</p>

<p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Social
useablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun to emerge, at least in form,
with little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd generation Patrician directed graph blockchain.
The underlying principle of the blockchain&#39;s micro-economic utiliity through crypto-
<i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions for Supply
&amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of the Hard Sciences of
Mathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Blockchains, Bitcoins and The Unnecessary Risk of Shopping at Target with a Credit Card, Part III:
<br />
<br /> Seven Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy
<br />
<small class="jargon">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! The first 3 of 7 new possibilities thanks to the programmable
blockchain.</small>
</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">The guiding light through the centuries of scientific paradigms, in the Kuhnian sense
<sup id="19-1">1</sup>, have derived from deductive ideas from above - whether priestly or royal decree. Then, the primacy of the
<i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then other Paradigm
Shifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment authors of 17th, 18th
century. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era&#39;s emerging paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority
and responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment.
<i>Historical Materialism</i>
<sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from governmental,
financial sources, but rather the
<i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the revolutionary
shift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable data-sharing. Cryptography
has in a sense become a
<i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property.</p>

<p>
<strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong>
<br /> Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical proof, rather
than exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern period also has held this
decentralized, individual authority as the
<i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions of humankind,
not idealogies. In fact, it was the
<i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western Philosophy,
by laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical &quot;ground&quot; upward. This &quot;upside-down
tree&quot; defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of
<i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism, as argued
in Sartre&#39;s
<i>Search for a Method</i>.
<sup>3</sup>
</p>

<p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations since Hegel.
I&#39;m so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels. First, cryptography
resemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern social rule (Some once thought
nuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown. Secondly, I&#39;m still dumbfounded that
a Paradigm Shift
<i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for a society that
is provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!</p>

<p>
<strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong>
</p>

<p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon thousands of
open-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum Virtual Machine, whose
aims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for removing the &quot;middle-person&quot;
from the day-to-day, micro-economic &quot;cost of living&quot;. This goes for for the exchanging of titles, legal
documents, etc.</p>

<p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing necessity in allocating
increasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of
<i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms on the near
horizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on
<i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient by means of
blockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing, etc.</p>

<p>
<strong>III. Removing Double-Dipping from International Remittances </strong>
</p>

<p>
<i>&quot;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&quot;
</i>
<br /> --Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, 1939</p>

<p>Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute;
la Western Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. The existing remittance system (not speaking
to
<i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian friend&#39;s
Canadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national payments systems,
thus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut. Like everything else--c&#39;est la vie. Or is it?
The beauty of Ethereum is that it &quot;talks&quot; well with others and across borders, while Bitcoin remains of
little use for micro-transactions that involve semi-basic calculations. The reason being that Bitcoin blockchain
language, Script, cannot support loops (while statements, etc.)</p>

<p>Currently, both EOS and Ethereum blockchains appear poised for the most financial-friendly blockchain tech.</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Blockchains, Bitcoins and The Unnecessary Risk of Shopping at Target with a Credit Card, Part IV:
<br />
<br /> Seven Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy
<br />
<small class="jargon">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! The 4th through 7th outlined Features of the New Blockchain
Micro-Economy</small>
</h6>
&nbsp;

<p class="firstparagraph">I feel that data is one of the more underestimated new commodities of the age. Most visualize data as rows and columns,
and at most only non-conditional dynamic data. Data are not so mute! Data, in most object-oriented languages at
least, represents
<i>functions</i>, conditions, and predicted values. And so, our own behavior, coupled with our networks&#39; behavior,
coupled with predictive analytics--this represents a wealth of information beyond our attributed or inherited traits.
The programming is
<i>in</i> the data, however, citizens have become less and less involved, ceding app by centralized app our own information
and ensuring profit to 3rd party marketers. The centralized nature of the internet allows for this, while the new
landscape of
<i>decentralized applications</i> (DAPP) completely upends this structure of the status quo.</p>

<p>
<strong>IV. Enabling citizens to own &amp; monetize their data (&amp; protect privacy)</strong>
<br /> Ethereum offers a decentralized solution to &quot;owning&quot; one&#39;s own data, as data can be decentralized
and returned to the individual&#39;s control, and
<i>profit</i>. As sure as the 19th century&#39;s &quot;labor-hour&quot; became commodified to a calculable asset, i.e.
property, which
<i>another</i> party controls and makes profit; And as sure as the 20th century&#39;s data analytics became commodified
into calculable assets for another party to take control and make profit; then only now in this 21st century does
technology offer a new, more egalitarian path.</p>

<p>
<strong>V. Ensuring compensation for the Creators of Value </strong>
<br /> So, how would decentralized innovations of blockchain
<i>distributed ledger</i> technology compensate those whose actions, behavior, opinions, friend-networks, artwork,
music, videos and other contributions profit the creator?</p>

<p>
<strong>VI. The Halcyon Age of Transaction-Chain Enterprise</strong>
</p>

<p class="quote">According to Greek Mythology, the days of eery, noticeable lack of storms have never been interpreted as a period
of grace. Moreso,
<i>Halcyon</i> tranquility only means a temporary moratorium on the winds and waves, imposed by Aeolus, God of Wind,
to protect the nesting eggs of Alcyone, his daughter.</p>

<p>If blockchain tech changes how we do research, analysis, and forecasting, as much as it changes international, and
cross-industry transactions, then are we faced with a similar dilemma as the &quot;novelty&quot;, and double-dealing,
of multi-nationals of the 1990s? No, because blockchain renders organizations, even those with a spotty past, into
transparent, democratic, efficient, secure and easily scrutinized.</p>

<p>After all, without transparent proof, how else would I know my bananas are the &quot;pura vida&quot; Costa Rique&ntilde;
ones? More importantly, what was the carbon footprint of that banana&#39;s journey from its native soil to my breakfast
table? New blockchain companies like
<a href="https://www.provenance.org/">Provenance.org</a>,
<a href="http://www.skuchain.com/" target="_blank">skuchain</a>,
<a href="http://www.blockverify.io/">http://www.blockverify.io/</a> are a few noticeable game-changers. So, for bananas not backed by mathematical proofs,
I really have to ask myself, is it
<i>really</i> an authentic Fair Trade banana?</p>

<p>Transactions are hardly valuable in the products themselves, if removed from the value of the
<i>transaction per se</i>. International supply chain transactions, by virtue of a recently possible decentralized,
permanent record and monitoring, have begun to make inroads in agriculture, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, food-supply

<h5 class="subdailytech">Data Analysis Musing</h5>

<p class="author">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber">Feb 21, 2018</h6>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Facebook-Friendly Third-Generation Data Structures</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Today, I&#39;m going to write about data structures, and challenges that face Vitalik Buterin and other blockchain
architects. &#39; Now, why in the
<i>world</i> would I or anyone else care about ooh, merge sorts, bubble sorts, classificatory trees, and the advent
of a third form of data structure?</p>

<p>Today, we live in an ever more relational world. With all our technology, we just can&#39;t wait to hear the latest
gossip about sister Becky&#39;s Boyfriend&#39;s Brother&#39;s Friend that
<i>also</i> got to meet Shakira. Gossip to one person is a valuable asset to the data analyst. Because, how else could
an algorithm draw simultaneous conclusions about two friends that &quot;liked&quot; the same Samsung VR, and that
they are both located near Best Buy. Thanks to classificatorial wisdom of AI &amp; plain machine-learning?</p>

<p>These relational queries are simply too difficult for relational, row &amp; column SQL data structures. In fact,
many queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures. Next, with the need to &quot;objectify&quot;
data into non-relational objects, rather than an antiquated, rigid row-and-column design. Thus, the second major
type of data structure is more flexible and adept in finding these relational queries that are ever more in vogue.
However, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational, No-SQL designs quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability.
Between a rock and a hard place, a third data structure has emerged in recent years.</p>

<p>Graph Data Structures
<sup>2</sup> allow data queries that had otherwise been impossible to capture in an entity relationship diagram. The
ideal example to clarify is the manner that the Swiss banks&#39; accounts were discovered to be hiding vast amounts
of hidden taxes, etc. The cover-up was so well-constructed that not until new, graph database queries discovered
patterns of money flow
<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<p class="quote">The data was then turned into a graph format to detect then fine-tune the connections between the nodes. The Swiss
Leak held around 60,000 files that contained information about over 100,000 clients in 203 countries, which means
that the resulting graph database had more than 275,000 nodes with 400,000 relationships among them.</p>

<p class="quote">By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections
than they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and regulators
across the globe.</p>

<p>And you thought that plagiarism-detecting software was impressive for complexity! The beauty of this newly available
software (even Microsoft jumped on board in recent years) means that sociologists, economists can begin to make
better headway in the way that our many interactions become more complex with more data. Remember, in the past ten
minutes, more data information was just produced than most of human history! Thus, new and upcoming needs in domains
like content management &amp; access control, geo-routing (public transportation), gene sequencing, bio-informatics,
and so on. So, as technology takes us forward, and we make our considerations, let&#39;s stick by the golden rules
of parallel processing, scalability, and, now, graph-network mindedness for the new data structures, and schema,
of the Era!</p>

<h5 class="subdailytech bc">Musing Blockchain</h5>

<p class="author">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber">Feb 22, 2018</h6>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Languages</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">While I&#39;ve had blockchain-related topics on the mind lately, it seems I can&#39;t escape it as I broach new fields--blockchain
is everywhere! Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated speed of language and syntax formation,
and the curious phenomenon I&#39;d call, for lack of a better word or or my own reading, &quot;declarative-syntax-merging&quot;.
This involves the curious, and largely unknown, growth of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain
of web apps, data analysis, and even the bounds of
<i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won&#39;t submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say that, &quot;If
a certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed in JavaScript.&quot;</p>

<p>Without getting into technicals, I&#39;ll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged with
French, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand years later,
we can see how English grammar inherited it&#39;s Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the core vocabulary;
Then, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;house&quot;
from &quot;melche&quot; or &quot;haus&quot;, then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from
French, e.g. &quot;lactose&quot; or &quot;mansion&quot; from &quot;lait&quot; or &quot;maison&quot;.</p>

<p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new language called
Solidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English&#39;s time. The usual FOMO logic propels coding language use,
for example FOMO induced Microsoft&#39;s flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt it years ago.
<sup id="22-1">1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents, one non-legitimate.
It is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of C++. For the layperson, let&#39;s
just say Solidity resembles a &quot;Liger&quot;, in it is at it&#39;s core JavaScript, yet with increasing sophistication
based on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the powerful machine-code of C++ ever more. And it
is a beautiful, but curious phenomonenon.</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">1.4 Million Reasons for more Women in Tech</h6>
<a href="#18-03-08" rel="stylesheet">Blog addressed again March 8, 2018 </a>

<p class="firstparagraph">1.4 million
<i>new</i> jobs by 2020; End over end, year after year, the computer programming industry continues to add another
20% more jobs each year, for the next five years. This is the only field that demand outstrips the supply--and increasingly
short supply. So much so, the US Department of Labor forecasts U.S. citizens will be able to fill 39% of those positions;
there are not enough Immigration visas (especially in the Trumpian era of isolationism) to make up the rest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, how is it that only 14% of females in the entire field of cybersecurity? Silicon Valley is, at its best, obscenely
one-sided. At Google, only 17% of the company&#39;s tech jobs are filled by women. Facebook women staff only 15%
of tech jobs, and Twitter? 10% female. The figures on women in computer science across the nation, across the entire
industry are not improving, but
<i>declining</i>?
<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>Of course, we&#39;ve heard these statistics from any given headline, and in the halls across the university landscape,
starting with Women in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Mathematics) programs.
<sup>3</sup> Yet, why, with so much money, so many programs, so many non-governmental, non-profit effort?</p>

<p>I argue that tech
<i>climate </i> is directly to blame. Who then? Not a person, but principles are to blame. Culture--often defined as
shared beliefs, norms, language and behaviors--can hardly be changed, but it can be understood.
<br /> There is a book, called &quot;Program or be Programmed
<sup id="24-4">4</sup>
</p>
, by which the author explains social consequences of a dichotomized society--between those that manipulate the environment
around them, whether automating tasks at work, or simply fixing a simple software bug, by adding a comma. This literacy
of the Current Era is akin to the 26-letter alphabet of written sentences and paragraphs, and--not to be taken for
granted--is the exclusive form of communication, outside of a 100-foot perimeter, up until 150 years ago. Knowledge
is not power, the communication of knowledge is power.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I argue that today, the power is to program one application programming interface (API) to talk to another API. In
other words, the ability to directly communicate with software at the command-line is not now a requisite skill,
but promotions would not escape this necessity! So, now reverting back to the subject of women in tech, American
leadership is in deep peril without more female insight. I will finish by citing that Ares, the violent, untamed
Greek
<i>god of war</i>, cannot always drive the Capitalist engine; because She, Athena, the
<i>goddess of intelligence</i> represents true strategy!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Joys of Automation</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">While coding up a better shell for this website, I thought it&#39;s remarkable how our lives get easier and easier
with each passing year of tech. Using JavaScript--the primordial web-coding language--I marvel at the convenience
of delegating mundande coding stuff to taskrunners, like
<i>Gulp</i>--a programmable package manager that &quot;bundles&quot; up the libraries to be used in the app. It is
truly a joy!</p>

<p>I write four styling
<i>functions</i>, with about 16
<i>variables</i> and voil&agrave;! I finish in 3 hours what would have taken me 15 hours, then another 5 hours a month
for upkeep. Instead, now, it&#39;s as though I wind up the clock, and need only periodically check, and perhaps
update a variable or two ... Technology. I&#39;m gushing for joy.</p>

<p>This was mere JavaScript--with a truly
<i>Turing Complete</i>--pan-algorithm status--languages, the possibilities are 100-fold with Python language library
collection; this library collection includes NASA modules, mathematical proofs, and limitless uses from web-scraping
for unstructured data to an excellent data visualization collection. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m in the Library
of Congress, and better yet because, PIP, the Python package manager acts and automates like a cyborg librarian,
for lack of better imagery.</p>

<p>I just have so much joy watching a project come to life, and it&#39;s even a greater delight if this project comes
to life and stays alive, through the joys of automation!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Cryptocurrency&#39;s Cumbersome Carbon Footprint</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">I must confess that on the very day that Our Daily Tech Blog gets an under-the-head make-over for security&#39;s
sake, I wrote the new formatting file right over today&#39;s post. Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously
as I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether I change my
ways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely, Sustainability, a.k.a.
Carbon Footprint.</p>

<p class="quote">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms that build
a record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a bitcoin for their efforts.
<sup id="explain">1</sup>
</p>

<p>Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high electricity
bills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity is gobbled up by small
and large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations!
<sup id="electricity">1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other &quot;Proof-of-Work&quot; designs require electricity because
the investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for mining drives
the system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations.</p>

<p>So, is the electricity consumption really
<i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis site
<sup
id="digiconomist">3</sup> estimates
<i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity&#39;s mining. (A visa credit card transaction
is 0.00651 kWh. The entire Ethereum global blockchain could be &quot;using as much as 4.2 Terawatt-hours (tWh),
or slightly more than the country of Cyprus
<sup id="cyprus">1</sup>.&quot; So, electricity comparisons are telling, but how does this relate to its environment impact, sustainability
itself?</p>

<p>Carbon Footprint, our energy consumption index, can be compared to another element of scarcity, which dictates fluctuations
in value: Gold. According to
<i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household&#39;s Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article does
the math for us very succinctly:</p>

<p class="quote">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just more energy-intensive, but also has
a bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon footprint for both.
For Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. For gold, we assume a carbon
footprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined
<sup id="digiconomist2">3</sup>.</p>

<p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin&#39;s worth
of Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2). At the end of the day, the electricity costs--if not sustainable long-term--could
spell trouble. Hence, the three S&#39;s, mentioned last, sustainability is perhaps a larger issue than blockchain
Security and Scalability challenges. Again, this is a problem that the third largest cryptocurrency does not have:
<i>Ripple</i>, which does not bear a carbon footprint
<sup id="ripple">4</sup>.</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">After Yesterday&#39;s Scathing Post, A Look at my own Carbon Footprint</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">In my reflections about environment sustainability issues, I confess I&#39;m sort of a hypocrite ... The whole matter
that caused my own introspection begins with my usual daily vexation: Tangles of wires!
<br /> &nbsp; ... I&#39;ve been having electricity issues, here as of late ...</p>

<p>On one side, my tiny Yoga Ultrabook usually likes to charge just fine with my phone charger--if I&#39;m stuck without
my charger. And due to an untimely end to the charger, I needed a replacement. So, singular errand of the day was
a trip to Best Buy to peruse for a 45-Watt USB-C charger ( the new oval charging port on Samsung 8&#39;s, LG G6&#39;s
and newer Apple products).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my credit-card sized Raspberry Pi computer runs on an old-school USB charger--a whole Linux Server Tower
on a cell-phone charger. Then, we have my trusty Dell (actual) Tower with 16 Gigs of RAM, 2-terabytes, etc. that
also seems to need an extra fan to stay cool--probably the sustainability of 100 Raspberry computers. My entire
carbon footprint changes more with the electrical products that I use, than my vehicle! Well, I also confess my
Jeep Cherokee can&#39;t even boast 20 miles per hour ... oops, conscience pangs, ouch ... Well, hypocritical, slightly,
but found not guilty since I&#39;m a bike-commuter for life!</p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">One Last Word about Bitcoin&#39;s Carbon Footprint</h6>

<p class="firstparagraph">Environmental Sustainability, again, and a higher-level view of the dilemmea...I couldn&#39;t resist:
<br /> Bitcoin&#39;s Initial Coin Offering was 2011 or so, then Ethereum, with Ether for currency was 2015; These two,
ever so prescient designs, also have their Achilles Heal. These two are
<strong>&quot;Proof of Work&quot; currency algorithsms</strong>. This means that the &quot;Demand&quot; side of supply-and-demand,
derives from
<i>difficulty levels</i> of crypto-blocks to mine. So, miners are incentivized to spend $1500 on a semi-mediocre-good
mining rig (which is basically 20 NVIDIA Graphics Cards tied together to stack of two-by-fours with lots of fans
... erhem, sustainability?...</p>

<p>And for each block that is &quot;solved&quot;, hence the block being validated, and somebody&#39;s cryptocurrency
purchase/transaction is resolved! (takes about 12 minutes for the whole global blockchain to cycle, and Ethereum
is less than a minute). So, the whole cycle continues, churning through coal- and carbon-stained hands of the electricity
fed to these crypto-mining rigs
<sup>1</sup>. For many it&#39;s a hobby, like the British Hobbyists&#39; love for ham- and short-wave radio setups, yet
this profitable, yet particular hobby resembles the 1870&#39;s coal factory smoke stacks in South London!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, if Ethereum is able to successfully hard-fork to a Proof-of-Stake system soon--and Vitalik Buterin
and his crew assure us it is coming
<sup>2</sup>--then great--problem solved, everything eventually converts to Ethereum. If
<i>not</i>they face an existential threat. Because, in a more enlightened ten years from now, those mining depots
<i>would</i> look like unfettered factory smoke-stacks. Proof-of-Stack, whose currency value is not set to difficult
of algorithm puzzle (hence,
<i>proof-of-work</i>, but rather to ownership of &quot;voting pools&quot;, which is a
<i>
<strong>Consensus-Based Blockchain algorithm</strong>
</i> [Complex subject best reserved for a rainy day, or better yet, no day! I may revisit this alternative in a funner
way, here&#39;s a glimpse from Vitalk&#39;s @VitalikButerin tweet yesterday:</p>

<p class="quote">Question for mathematicians: is there a assumed-to-be-normal number (ie. digits are random, like pi or e) where you
can calculate the nth digit in log(n) (or even polylog(n)) time? If so, then H(x) = digits[x ... x+100] seems like
it would be a cool cryptographic hash algo.</p>

<p>Now, I am by no means a detective, but by the sound of those tweets, the Proof-of-Work algorithm seems to still be
of utmost importance ...</p>

<h4 class="center">My Beliefs &amp; Our Daily Tech Blog Mission</h4>

<p class="dailytitle" >by Thomas Maestas, MA</p> 
 
 <p class="firstparagraph">Dialectical Materialism<br />I construct my philosophical guidance from a post-Hegelian, Historical-Materialist Philosophy that sees improvement by each iteration of problem-solving. My personal philosophy holds that right actions and true knowledge begin with a final, teleological goal in sight, i.e., the <i>improvement of the Human condition</i>. <br />Post-Hegelian Logic determines a set, then compares the practical <i>thesis</i> of present empirical, perceived conditions against the ideal <i>antithesis</i> toward higher ethical, rational solutions, in order to achieve an improved synthesis, to again be repeated as a new thesis.</p>
<p class="firstparagraph">Sharing<br />    
Given that assumptions about population growth and climate change are true (I believe both are true), then global population well-being is threatened earlier than expected. Therefore, my antithesis holds that  smart, effective <i>Sharing of Burden</i>, Sharing of Power, and <i>Sharing of Resources</i> is critical to meeting the imminent challenges of the two said assumptions.  
</p>
<p class="firstparagraph">Diversity and Equality<br />
Workplace culture too often abides by the ethos of "work harder, not smarter." Non-diverse workplaces lack the full set of problem-solving tools that are necessary in a complex, diverse world. 
</p>
<p>A better workforce integration along gender, racial, and socio-economic lines is a more heterogeneous workforce: more agile, creative, and efficiently team-oriented workforce--in short, a smarter workforce.
</p>
<!--
<p class="quote">1. Quantitative Measure. <br />I argue my antithesis by comparing the gender, racial, and socio-economic heterogeneity of American, British, French, and Japanese workforce, as measured by N=600 sampling method of companies of 50 or few employees, 51-200, and 200+ employees. My conclusion focuses on gender-specific solutions, especially in programming-related fields.</p>
<p class="quote">2. Qualitative Measure. <br />Using <i>Intersectionality Theory</i><sup>2</sup>, I qualitatively argue my antithesis beginning with female inclusion into programming-related fields, which now many still call a "Boys' Club" within the computer-programming sector.  16 interviews to explore the effects of continual, disproportionately male-dominated,  programming-related fields. </p>

                  <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Why are Sociologists now the Key Players in Data Analysis within the Domain of Blockchain Technologies?</h6>















                  <p class="firstparagraph">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin
                    and other cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology
                    (peer-to-peer global ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate,
                    individual needs and uses. These blockchain "network" analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network
                    changes, node changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly
                    or not. </p>



                  <p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships)
                    that include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain
                    tech must face analytical challenges that arise from informal practices
                    <sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role's protocol
                    for the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>















                  <p> Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan's (1977)
                    <i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple
                    <i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time,
                    convenience, etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm
                    human understanding
                    <i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of
                    a bank, a person, or a company's internal bot? </p>



                  <p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought
                    the world the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can only contribute little on how to interface
                    with social needs. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the
                    multi-dimensional layers of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks? Well
                    enough to differentiate qualitative meaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.















                  </p>







                  <p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved,
                    integrated through multiple layers of "middlemen", such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions,
                    non-governmental, non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases
                    the middlemen. Suddenly, one programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract,
                    that last month an entire team of hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing
                    different facets of this same thing. </p>



                  <p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the
                    life of the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years' Sociology Network
                    Analysts' research and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and
                    should not turn to the Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already
                    at home, safe within the academic domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and
                    so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology can either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances,
                    accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises. Or, the next ten years can follow Sociology's
                    Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful future. </p>







                  <p>















                    Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on review
                    of the Sociologists' specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships,
                    within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships.
                    We Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary,
                    yet are characterized by fixed patterns. </p>



                  <p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes
                    that characterize societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large
                    Number Statistical Theory become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900's Sociological French Network
                    Theories, like Maurice Halbswach's work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society's Collective
                    Memory.
                  </p>







                  <p>







                    No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic's "irrational behaviors"
                    and Mathematical "complexity models" do not
                    <i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate
                    simultaneous node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/
                    only 3 of 15 network groups get jobs), and most importantly the
                    <i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time
                    and fixed. </p>







                  <p>Fine. So, why is Sociology's network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th
                    and 20th centuries' network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era,
                    while </strong> North American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960's [post-1968],
                    U.S. in the 1990's[post-1999], in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of
                    past sociology are inherently small-data and more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates
                    "human-ness" into the billion rows and columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>







                  <p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation
                    for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of
                    each relationship (link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or
                    is changed; with this, it is possible to isolate directional, conditional
                    <i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation
                    <sup id="9one">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on
                    social networks. </p>







                  <p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person
                    <i>self-selects</i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group's
                    behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group's
                    behavior, by the group's influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder's SIENA software,
                    achieves the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology.
                    The network graph can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety
                    without hard forks), not as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary
                    assumptions that a set of nodes (social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are
                    known - except perhaps for a moderate amount of missing data</p>







                  <p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear,
                    directed path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists
                    are called upon, blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again
                    the same bugs. Sadly, this semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain
                    for their currency, contract, and other societal needs--in this case, the blind will indeed lead the
                    blind. </p>

                  <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">How Can We Best Modularize our App Designs in Order to Achieve the Much Vaunted "Separation of Concerns"?</h6>















                  <p class="firstparagraph">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed
                    Order of Coders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from
                    structural design. Hence, in the early 2000's, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to
                    abide by The scaffolding of HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we
                    must throw out this antiquated division of labor within web coding. </p>
                  <p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules
                    and components Must hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled
                    html, js, css, it is now requisite to divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget,
                    a team for the navigation widgets, and
                    <i> each</i> of these component teams
                    <strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module's required html, js, css. </p>
                  <p>







                    This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and all coding
                    will necessarily begin to 'reinvent the wheel.' This is because any module, any library you go to, will
                    <i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate
                    new css from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual
                    misery, almost instantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>



                  <p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher
                    level of abstraction, leaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice
                    in the modern world, and if ad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity?
                    If yesterday's craft was the hoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular
                    coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part by part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses
                    and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and pastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry.
                    Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module definition? That's absurd. Equally absurd is the
                    javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules. </p>



                  <p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an
                    age that each year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic
                    sugar and also fundamental structure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. Therefore, philosophical
                    Honor behooves each of us to a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the "Separation of Concerns."
                    We can allow ourselves a break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must
                    <i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create! </p>

                  <p class="firstparagraph">Facebook Scandals
                    <sup>1</sup> of recent months have demoralized the leadership for a role of misinformation in the Tech Age,
                    however I charge Mark Zuckerberg's innocence
                    <i>not</i> because all of us, as a society, were equally warned. Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created
                    abnormal, never-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were
                    so efficient at multiplying and exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon
                    rendered parts of our daily social learning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own
                    control.
                  </p>







                  <p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial
                    <sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation
                    were not entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural
                    changes from higher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in
                    their content and influence) begin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends
                    and opinionated critical thought becomes dominated by the relationships, e.g., the "likes" and "shares",
                    leading to a statistically natural propensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is
                    akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel to the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure),
                    a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal and tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers
                    out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary
                    <i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>
                  <p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual "interruptions" that
                    previously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains: </p>







                  <p class="quote">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication
                    that the timespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation
                    Bias, misinformation and outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that
                    are already hard to change. </p>

                  <p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,
                    <i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network
                    phenomonenon--ultimately driven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry,
                    conditional influences, and the strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these
                    factors, our social inclinations were
                    <i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were! </p>

                  <p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network
                    phenomena -- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!

                    <i>Anomie</i>
                  </h6>















                  <p class="firstparagraph">Given the tragic events at a Florida school over Valentine's Day, 2018, who can write about Fitbits? So,
                    thoughts and sympathy for those students today that endured this horror. 19 years after the first-of-its-kind
                    school shooting, we as an American society have not become 'numb' to these events. It hurts as much as
                    it did in 1999.</p>
                  <p> Darn that innocuous Spring day in 1999, when we heard the most absurd news-- students attacked their own
                    colleagues at Colombine? In my blog post from January 10, I wrote that American Sociology, along with
                    Qu&eacute;bec, came of age much later than European Sociology. The past 50 years' social changes and
                    new problems are generally atrributed for the increasing demand for sociological expertise after 1999,
                    after a singular, senseless tragedy of a school shooting--this event, like a small kernel of societal
                    desperation for a solution--led to a flurry of self-professed sociologists &agrave; la Michael Moore's
                    Colombine, and other social-responsibility themed social consciousness. So far, only mutually incompatible
                    solutions. The problem, however, is not new, only the manifestation of it.</p>
                  <p>Suicide rates in 19th century France, disproportionately high, also served as a symptomatic manifestation
                    of the same problem, called
                    <i>Anomie.</i>
                    <sup>1</sup> The term,
                    <i>Anomie</i>, coined by Emile Durkheim in the late 1800's, captured the sense of instability, cultural
                    and moral relativism that undermined a shared sense of meaning. Suicides, week-after-week, month-after-month?
                    In 1897 France, noone had ever seen it before--at such rates--and people wanted answers. Alas, a kernel
                    of social desperation leading to inquiry.</p>
                  <p>







                    People wanted to know why so many in the population responded negatively to the rapid changes, urbanization (Dreadful factory
                    conditions &agrave; la
                    <i>Taylorism's</i> calculated efficiency) new technologies, i.e. electricity, railroads, steam engines;
                    these created an arbitrarily new world, very suddenly. Suddenly, like trying for the first time a roller-coaster,
                    when all you've ever known has been the carousel. So, we see technology's role for well or for ill, our
                    job is to understand how to dial-in the tech specs necessary to keep society smiling on this roller coaster
                    through another, yet not altogether new, technological thrill-ride.

                  <h6>



                    <small class="jargon">Tech blockchain jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! I treat a broad overview of the
                      existing trajectory of blockchain-related micro-economic advancements. I make a technical &amp; contextualizing

                    </small>



                  </h6>



                  <p class="firstparagraph">Has anyone else been underwhelmed by the lack of Bitcoin's daily
                    <i>presence</i>, despite its everpresence at the dinner tables and caf&eacute;s across America. Sure, it's
                    more of a "metropolitan" phenomenon; and sure, it's become an accepted global platform--along with myriad
                    other crypto-currencies, but it's exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies
                    are useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency's
                    rise to fame with last year's increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its
                    contributions, uses, fame are one-sidedly
                    <i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article
                    <sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of
                    <i>actual</i> use at the "cash-registers" of society.</p>







                  <p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological
                    <i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Roger's Diffusion of Innovations
                    <sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger's bell
                    curve ranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However,
                    the blockchain articles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine
                    usefulness for the every-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>







                  <p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is
                    <i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific
                    information--whether financial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order
                    before I continue, since we can all relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most
                    notably concerning Target store credit card hacks a couple years ago. </p>
                  <p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions,
                    this person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction:
                    they prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that
                    $27, $200, or $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their
                    <i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and
                    if the store's databases are hacked, then tough-luck! </p>
                  <p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for
                    each transaction, providing the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient!
                    Nobody thinks to walk around with their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad
                    of cash and peel out a bill. The credit card system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology
                    to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions have had to rely on the many layers of security,
                    passwords, pins, mothers' maiden names, etc. Then, based on the mathematics behind prime numbers, they
                    hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright red target on it. </p>
                  <p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And
                    that, my friends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency,
                    instead the crypto-
                    <i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero's
                    name is the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide
                    pinpointed,
                    <i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for
                    the sake of renting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don't
                    need this. They need to know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire governmental
                    database of information about you!

                  <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle"> Tech on the Regret: Unintended, secondary effects of communication- and activity-based app-designs </h6>



























                  <p class="firstparagraph">Given that our app-use is inextricably tied up with our own behavior, activity/communication-based app
                    developers have in the past year accepted (mostly in word) a renewed responsibility. More like resposibility
                    for a multi-faceted power of influence granted to an industry, suddenly, disproportionately great, and
                    <i>semi-arbitrarily related</i> to the designer's intent (and control!). After all, if the Saintly Mark
                    Zuckerberg's activity/communication-based app inadvertantly led to novel, and deeply consequential, effects,
                    then anyone could. </p>
                  <p>After all, who could guess
                    <i>how</i> these app-design effects would affect the users, years later. Who do we think programmers are,
                    sociologists? More specifically, who could know
                    <i>which</i> mundane coding practices, arbitrary app-design--like sharing permissions/features? Sure, everyone
                    deep down knew their company practices yield unfathomable power of influence over the daily habits of
                    cell-users, a.k.a. everyone. The easy part is knowing; the hard part is learning how and why certain
                    app-features lead to behavioral risks.</p>
                  <p>There could be no better example than the Alcoholic faced with an intervention by a loving family longing
                    for change. The alcoholic could be forgiven for past misdeeds, but without actual
                    <i>Acknowledgement</i> of a crisis in direction, which necessitates professional help from social scientists.
                    Therefore, the recent
                    <i>acknowledgments</i> signify something deeper--they signify a humility that app-designers are not sociologists,
                    generally speaking. So, that means hiring sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists for every N
                    <small>th</small> app-coder and software engineer. History can't be rewritten, but it can be interpreted and
                    learned from. The acknowledgment is itself a victory if it induces learning from the raw, social sciences,
                    whose expertise
                    <i>can</i> predict how or why certain "life"-features, practices, and policies often unfold with undue and
                    unintended social consequences. </p>















                  <p>Water under the bridge, but going forward, it is one thing to claim a "renewed sense of remorse", another
                    to acknowledge, learn and change. Like last November
                    <sup>1</sup> when Facebook co-founder Sean Parker confessed certain designs like "social-validation feedback
                    loop" and other app-design intentions, while ignoring potential secondary effects on society. So, the
                    <i>Acknowledgment</i> is the big win here--not so much the remorse!

                    provide controversy and competing algorithms over sustainability, security, and scalability, then they
                    reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses (and potential effects) than they hide. In
                    my February 15th
                    <a href="#18-02-15">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects
                    of the crypto-contract horizon.</p>



                  <p>
                    <strong>Prologue</strong>



                  </p>



                  <p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the
                    <i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals?
                    First, a little background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum
                    blockchain helps distinguish itself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech,
                    like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based blockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming
                    features, e.g. "looping", "recursion", with the full power of a
                    <i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable
                    problem. </p>







                  <p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the
                    accounting system of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction,
                    An Ethereum blockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,
                    <i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks
                    to calculate into a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>







                  <p>Therefore, Ethereum's Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum
                    blockchain is actually a "Virtual Machine", like a a big networked "home computer". The native language
                    of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an
                    <i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home
                    computer, then directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman's terms, the manner that
                    modern-day app, for example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that
                    allows one programming system to interact with another, such as Instragram offers a "sharing API" that
                    connects to hardware contacts, thus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing
                    your instagram picture to your Facebook account, via your T-Mobile phone's contacts list. This API relationship
                    broadly describes the modern world we live in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information
                    with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system, which exchanges API information with your own contact list,
                    and so on, and our lives are made easier. </p>







                  <p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity
                    days; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise.
                    The reason being that digital math uses binary "on/off" calculations, while quantum math implicates a
                    tertiary,
                    <i>qubit</i> "simultaneous states". Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology,
                    both programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA's blockchain
                    design utilizes a
                    <i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one's transaction is entered into with a private-key, and
                    the blockchain moreso resembles a "Tangle" of a directed graph, which allows for computational "states".
                    IOTA recently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent
                    vulnerability. In truth, this was a case of user-error because users were
                    <i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer
                    could crack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough
                    now to cause damage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum
                    possibilities.



                  </p>



                  </p>



                  <p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the
                    trees. Social useablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun
                    to emerge, at least in form, with little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd
                    generation Patrician directed graph blockchain. The underlying principle of the blockchain's micro-economic
                    utiliity through crypto-
                    <i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions
                    for Supply &amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of
                    the Hard Sciences of Mathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.

                  <p class="firstparagraph">



                    The guiding light through the centuries of scientific paradigms, in the Kuhnian sense
                    <sup id="19-1">1</sup>, have derived from deductive ideas from above - whether priestly or royal decree. Then, the primacy
                    of the
                    <i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then
                    other Paradigm Shifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment
                    authors of 17th, 18th century. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era's emerging
                    paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority and responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment.
                    <i>Historical Materialism</i>
                    <sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from
                    governmental, financial sources, but rather the
                    <i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the
                    revolutionary shift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable
                    data-sharing. Cryptography has in a sense become a
                    <i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property. </p>







                  <p>



                    <strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong>
                    <br />Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical
                    proof, rather than exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern
                    period also has held this decentralized, individual authority as the
                    <i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions
                    of humankind, not idealogies. In fact, it was the
                    <i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western
                    Philosophy, by laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical "ground" upward. This "upside-down
                    tree" defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of
                    <i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism,
                    as argued in Sartre's
                    <i>Search for a Method</i>.
                    <sup>3</sup>
                  </p>



                  <p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations
                    since Hegel. I'm so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels.
                    First, cryptography resemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern
                    social rule (Some once thought nuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown.
                    Secondly, I'm still dumbfounded that a Paradigm Shift
                    <i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for
                    a society that is provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!



                  </p>







                  <p>
                    <strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong>
                  </p>



                  <p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon thousands
                    of open-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum Virtual
                    Machine, whose aims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for removing the
                    "middle-person" from the day-to-day, micro-economic "cost of living". This goes for for the exchanging
                    of titles, legal documents, etc. </p>
                  <p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing necessity
                    in allocating increasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of
                    <i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms
                    on the near horizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on
                    <i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient
                    by means of blockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing,
                    etc. </p>

                    <strong>III. Removing Double-Dipping from International Remittances </strong>



                  </p>



                  <p>
                    <i>"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take
                      away."



                    </i>



                    <br /> --Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, 1939</p>



                  <p>







                    Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute; la Western
                    Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. The existing remittance system (not speaking
                    to
                    <i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian
                    friend's Canadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national
                    payments systems, thus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut. Like everything else--c'est
                    la vie. Or is it? The beauty of Ethereum is that it "talks" well with others and across borders, while
                    Bitcoin remains of little use for micro-transactions that involve semi-basic calculations. The reason
                    being that Bitcoin blockchain language, Script, cannot support loops (while statements, etc.) </p>
                  <p>Currently, both EOS and Ethereum blockchains appear poised for the most financial-friendly blockchain tech.

                  <p class="firstparagraph">I feel that data is one of the more underestimated new commodities of the age. Most visualize data as rows
                    and columns, and at most only non-conditional dynamic data. Data are not so mute! Data, in most object-oriented
                    languages at least, represents
                    <i>functions</i>, conditions, and predicted values. And so, our own behavior, coupled with our networks'
                    behavior, coupled with predictive analytics--this represents a wealth of information beyond our attributed
                    or inherited traits. The programming is
                    <i>in</i> the data, however, citizens have become less and less involved, ceding app by centralized app
                    our own information and ensuring profit to 3rd party marketers. The centralized nature of the internet
                    allows for this, while the new landscape of
                    <i>decentralized applications</i> (DAPP) completely upends this structure of the status quo.

                  <p>
                    <strong>IV. Enabling citizens to own &amp; monetize their data (&amp; protect privacy)</strong>
                    <br /> Ethereum offers a decentralized solution to "owning" one's own data, as data can be decentralized and
                    returned to the individual's control, and
                    <i>profit</i>. As sure as the 19th century's "labor-hour" became commodified to a calculable asset, i.e.
                    property, which
                    <i>another</i> party controls and makes profit; And as sure as the 20th century's data analytics became
                    commodified into calculable assets for another party to take control and make profit; then only now in
                    this 21st century does technology offer a new, more egalitarian path.

                    </strong>



                    So, how would decentralized innovations of blockchain
                    <i>distributed ledger</i> technology compensate those whose actions, behavior, opinions, friend-networks,
                    artwork, music, videos and other contributions profit the creator?

                    <strong>VI. The Halcyon Age of Transaction-Chain Enterprise</strong>
                  </p>



                  <p class="quote">



                    According to Greek Mythology, the days of eery, noticeable lack of storms have never been interpreted as a period of grace.
                    Moreso,
                    <i>Halcyon</i> tranquility only means a temporary moratorium on the winds and waves, imposed by Aeolus,
                    God of Wind, to protect the nesting eggs of Alcyone, his daughter. </p>



                  <p> If blockchain tech changes how we do research, analysis, and forecasting, as much as it changes international,
                    and cross-industry transactions, then are we faced with a similar dilemma as the "novelty", and double-dealing,
                    of multi-nationals of the 1990s? No, because blockchain renders organizations, even those with a spotty
                    past, into transparent, democratic, efficient, secure and easily scrutinized.



                  </p>



                  <p>



                    After all, without transparent proof, how else would I know my bananas are the "pura vida" Costa Rique&ntilde; ones? More
                    importantly, what was the carbon footprint of that banana's journey from its native soil to my breakfast
                    table? New blockchain companies like
                    <a href="https://www.provenance.org/">Provenance.org</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.skuchain.com/" target="_blank">skuchain</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.blockverify.io/">http://www.blockverify.io/</a> are a few noticeable game-changers. So, for bananas not backed by mathematical
                    proofs, I really have to ask myself, is it
                    <i>really</i> an authentic Fair Trade banana? </p>







                  <p>Transactions are hardly valuable in the products themselves, if removed from the value of the
                    <i>transaction per se</i>. International supply chain transactions, by virtue of a recently possible decentralized,
                    permanent record and monitoring, have begun to make inroads in agriculture, petroleum, pharmaceuticals,
                    food-supply and other multi-stage industries. </p>







                  <p>If corporate and governmental transactions are to be made public--many bearing enterprise or State secrets,
                    then will forecasting also go the way of birds? Possibly. Online platforms like Augur
                    <sup id="20-8">8</sup>are creating global, decentralized prediction markets, in domains like sports betting, financial
                    markets speculation and so forth. Armed with vast, transparent knowledge, the everyday person can now
                    access the whims and power of Aeolus, and forecasting the winds of Fortune.</p>

                  <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Facebook-Friendly Third-Generation Data Structures</h6>







                  <p class="firstparagraph">Today, I'm going to write about data structures, and challenges that face Vitalik Buterin and other blockchain
                    architects. ' Now, why in the
                    <i>world</i> would I or anyone else care about ooh, merge sorts, bubble sorts, classificatory trees, and
                    the advent of a third form of data structure? </p>



                  <p>Today, we live in an ever more relational world. With all our technology, we just can't wait to hear the
                    latest gossip about sister Becky's Boyfriend's Brother's Friend that
                    <i>also</i> got to meet Shakira. Gossip to one person is a valuable asset to the data analyst. Because,
                    how else could an algorithm draw simultaneous conclusions about two friends that "liked" the same Samsung
                    VR, and that they are both located near Best Buy. Thanks to classificatorial wisdom of AI &amp; plain
                    machine-learning? </p>



                  <p>These relational queries are simply too difficult for relational, row & column SQL data structures. In
                    fact, many queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures. Next, with the need
                    to "objectify" data into non-relational objects, rather than an antiquated, rigid row-and-column design.
                    Thus, the second major type of data structure is more flexible and adept in finding these relational
                    queries that are ever more in vogue. However, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational, No-SQL designs
                    quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability. Between a rock and a hard place, a third data
                    structure has emerged in recent years.</p>
                  <p>



                    Graph Data Structures
                    <sup>2</sup> allow data queries that had otherwise been impossible to capture in an entity relationship diagram.
                    The ideal example to clarify is the manner that the Swiss banks' accounts were discovered to be hiding
                    vast amounts of hidden taxes, etc. The cover-up was so well-constructed that not until new, graph database
                    queries discovered patterns of money flow
                    <sup>1</sup>:



                  </p>



                  <p class="quote">



                    The data was then turned into a graph format to detect then fine-tune the connections between the nodes. The Swiss Leak held
                    around 60,000 files that contained information about over 100,000 clients in 203 countries, which means
                    that the resulting graph database had more than 275,000 nodes with 400,000 relationships among them.
                  </p>



                  <p class="quote">



                    By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections than
                    they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and regulators
                    across the globe.







                  </p>



                  <p>And you thought that plagiarism-detecting software was impressive for complexity! The beauty of this newly
                    available software (even Microsoft jumped on board in recent years) means that sociologists, economists
                    can begin to make better headway in the way that our many interactions become more complex with more
                    data. Remember, in the past ten minutes, more data information was just produced than most of human history!
                    Thus, new and upcoming needs in domains like content management &amp; access control, geo-routing (public
                    transportation), gene sequencing, bio-informatics, and so on. So, as technology takes us forward, and
                    we make our considerations, let's stick by the golden rules of parallel processing, scalability, and,
                    now, graph-network mindedness for the new data structures, and schema, of the Era!

                  <h6 class="chapternumber">







                    Feb 22, 2018</h6>







                  <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Languages</h6>







                  <p class="firstparagraph">While I've had blockchain-related topics on the mind lately, it seems I can't escape it as I broach new
                    fields--blockchain is everywhere! Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated speed
                    of language and syntax formation, and the curious phenomenon I'd call, for lack of a better word or or
                    my own reading, "declarative-syntax-merging". This involves the curious, and largely unknown, growth
                    of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain of web apps, data analysis, and even the bounds
                    of
                    <i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won't submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say that,
                    "If a certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed in
                    JavaScript."



                  </p>



                  <p>Without getting into technicals, I'll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged
                    with French, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand
                    years later, we can see how English grammar inherited it's Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the
                    core vocabulary; Then, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. "milk"
                    or "house" from "melche" or "haus", then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from
                    French, e.g. "lactose" or "mansion" from "lait" or "maison".</p>



                  <p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new
                    language called Solidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English's time. The usual FOMO logic propels
                    coding language use, for example FOMO induced Microsoft's flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt
                    it years ago.
                    <sup id="22-1">1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents,
                    one non-legitimate. It is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of C++.
                    For the layperson, let's just say Solidity resembles a "Liger", in it is at it's core JavaScript, yet
                    with increasing sophistication based on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the powerful
                    machine-code of C++ ever more. And it is a beautiful, but curious phenomonenon.

                  <p class="firstparagraph">1.4 million
                    <i>new</i> jobs by 2020; End over end, year after year, the computer programming industry continues to add
                    another 20% more jobs each year, for the next five years. This is the only field that demand outstrips
                    the supply--and increasingly short supply. So much so, the US Department of Labor forecasts U.S. citizens
                    will be able to fill 39% of those positions; there are not enough Immigration visas (especially in the
                    Trumpian era of isolationism) to make up the rest. </p>



                  <p>



                  </p>



                  <p>So, how is it that only 14% of females in the entire field of cybersecurity? Silicon Valley is, at its
                    best, obscenely one-sided. At Google, only 17% of the company's tech jobs are filled by women. Facebook
                    women staff only 15% of tech jobs, and Twitter? 10% female. The figures on women in computer science
                    across the nation, across the entire industry are not improving, but
                    <i>declining</i>?
                    <sup>1</sup>



                  </p>



                  <p>Of course, we've heard these statistics from any given headline, and in the halls across the university
                    landscape, starting with Women in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Mathematics) programs.
                    <sup>3</sup> Yet, why, with so much money, so many programs, so many non-governmental, non-profit effort?



                  </p>



                  <p>I argue that tech
                    <i>climate
                      <sup id="24-3"></sup>
                    </i> is directly to blame. Who then? Not a person, but principles are to blame. Culture--often defined as
                    shared beliefs, norms, language and behaviors--can hardly be changed, but it can be understood.



                    <br />There is a book, called "Program or be Programmed
                    <sup id="24-4">4</sup>
                  </p>, by which the author explains social consequences of a dichotomized society--between those that manipulate
                  the environment around them, whether automating tasks at work, or simply fixing a simple software bug,
                  by adding a comma. This literacy of the Current Era is akin to the 26-letter alphabet of written sentences
                  and paragraphs, and--not to be taken for granted--is the exclusive form of communication, outside of a
                  100-foot perimeter, up until 150 years ago. Knowledge is not power, the communication of knowledge is power.</p>



                  <p>I argue that today, the power is to program one application programming interface (API) to talk to another
                    API. In other words, the ability to directly communicate with software at the command-line is not now
                    a requisite skill, but promotions would not escape this necessity! So, now reverting back to the subject
                    of women in tech, American leadership is in deep peril without more female insight. I will finish by
                    citing that Ares, the violent, untamed Greek
                    <i>god of war</i>, cannot always drive the Capitalist engine; because She, Athena, the
                    <i>goddess of intelligence</i> represents true strategy!

                    While coding up a better shell for this website, I thought it's remarkable how our lives get easier and easier with each
                    passing year of tech. Using JavaScript--the primordial web-coding language--I marvel at the convenience
                    of delegating mundande coding stuff to taskrunners, like
                    <i>Gulp</i>--a programmable package manager that "bundles" up the libraries to be used in the app. It is
                    truly a joy! </p>



                  <p>I write four styling
                    <i>functions</i>, with about 16
                    <i>variables</i> and voil&agrave;! I finish in 3 hours what would have taken me 15 hours, then another 5
                    hours a month for upkeep. Instead, now, it's as though I wind up the clock, and need only periodically
                    check, and perhaps update a variable or two ... Technology. I'm gushing for joy.</p>

                  <p class="firstparagraph">







                    I must confess that on the very day that Our Daily Tech Blog gets an under-the-head make-over for security's sake, I wrote
                    the new formatting file right over today's post. Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously
                    as I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether
                    I change my ways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely,
                    Sustainability, a.k.a. Carbon Footprint.</p>

                  <p class="quote">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms
                    that build a record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a bitcoin
                    for their efforts.
                    <sup id="explain">1</sup>

                  </p>

                  <p> Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high electricity
                    bills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity is gobbled
                    up by small and large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations!
                    <sup id="electricity">1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other "Proof-of-Work" designs require electricity because
                    the investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for mining
                    drives the system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations. </p>



                  <p>So, is the electricity consumption really
                    <i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis
                    site
                    <sup id="digiconomist">3</sup> estimates
                    <i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity's mining. (A visa credit card
                    transaction is 0.00651 kWh. The entire Ethereum global blockchain could be "using as much as 4.2 Terawatt-hours
                    (tWh), or slightly more than the country of Cyprus
                    <sup id="cyprus">1</sup>." So, electricity comparisons are telling, but how does this relate to its environment impact,
                    sustainability itself?</p>

                  <p>Carbon Footprint, our energy consumption index, can be compared to another element of scarcity, which dictates
                    fluctuations in value: Gold. According to
                    <i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household's Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article
                    does the math for us very succinctly: </p>

                  <p class="quote">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn’t just more energy-intensive, but also
                    has a bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon footprint
                    for both. For Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. For gold,
                    we assume a carbon footprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined
                    <sup id="digiconomist2">3</sup>.

                  </p>

                  <p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin's
                    worth of Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2). At the end of the day, the electricity costs--if not sustainable
                    long-term--could spell trouble. Hence, the three S's, mentioned last, sustainability is perhaps a larger
                    issue than blockchain Security and Scalability challenges. Again, this is a problem that the third largest
                    cryptocurrency does not have:
                    <i>Ripple</i>, which does not bear a carbon footprint
                    <sup id="ripple">4</sup>.

                  </p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p class="firstparagraph">In my reflections about environment sustainability issues, I confess I'm sort of a hypocrite ... The whole
                    matter that caused my own introspection begins with my usual daily vexation: Tangles of wires!
                    <br /> &nbsp; ... I've been having electricity issues, here as of late ...</p>

                  <p>

                    On one side, my tiny Yoga Ultrabook usually likes to charge just fine with my phone charger--if I'm stuck without my charger.
                    And due to an untimely end to the charger, I needed a replacement. So, singular errand of the day was
                    a trip to Best Buy to peruse for a 45-Watt USB-C charger ( the new oval charging port on Samsung 8's,
                    LG G6's and newer Apple products).
                    <p>Meanwhile, my credit-card sized Raspberry Pi computer runs on an old-school USB charger--a whole Linux
                      Server Tower on a cell-phone charger. Then, we have my trusty Dell (actual) Tower with 16 Gigs of RAM,
                      2-terabytes, etc. that also seems to need an extra fan to stay cool--probably the sustainability of
                      100 Raspberry computers. My entire carbon footprint changes more with the electrical products that
                      I use, than my vehicle! Well, I also confess my Jeep Cherokee can't even boast 20 miles per hour ...
                      oops, conscience pangs, ouch ... Well, hypocritical, slightly, but found not guilty since I'm a bike-commuter
                      for life!</p>

                  <p class="firstparagraph">Environmental Sustainability, again, and a higher-level view of the dilemmea...I couldn't resist:
                    <br /> Bitcoin's Initial Coin Offering was 2011 or so, then Ethereum, with Ether for currency was 2015; These
                    two, ever so prescient designs, also have their Achilles Heal. These two are
                    <strong>"Proof of Work" currency algorithsms</strong>. This means that the "Demand" side of supply-and-demand,
                    derives from
                    <i>difficulty levels</i> of crypto-blocks to mine. So, miners are incentivized to spend $1500 on a semi-mediocre-good
                    mining rig (which is basically 20 NVIDIA Graphics Cards tied together to stack of two-by-fours with lots
                    of fans ... erhem, sustainability?...</p>
                  <p>And for each block that is "solved", hence the block being validated, and somebody's cryptocurrency purchase/transaction
                    is resolved! (takes about 12 minutes for the whole global blockchain to cycle, and Ethereum is less than
                    a minute). So, the whole cycle continues, churning through coal- and carbon-stained hands of the electricity
                    fed to these crypto-mining rigs
                    <sup>1</sup>. For many it's a hobby, like the British Hobbyists' love for ham- and short-wave radio setups,
                    yet this profitable, yet particular hobby resembles the 1870's coal factory smoke stacks in South London!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Let's face it, if Ethereum is able to successfully hard-fork to a Proof-of-Stake system soon--and Vitalik Buterin and his
                    crew assure us it is coming
                    <sup>2</sup>--then great--problem solved, everything eventually converts to Ethereum. If
                    <i>not</i>they face an existential threat. Because, in a more enlightened ten years from now, those mining
                    depots
                    <i>would</i> look like unfettered factory smoke-stacks. Proof-of-Stack, whose currency value is not set
                    to difficult of algorithm puzzle (hence,
                    <i>proof-of-work</i>, but rather to ownership of "voting pools", which is a
                    <i>
                      <strong>Consensus-Based Blockchain algorithm</strong>

                    in a funner way, here's a glimpse from Vitalk's @VitalikButerin tweet yesterday:</p>
                  <p class="quote">Question for mathematicians: is there a assumed-to-be-normal number (ie. digits are random, like pi or
                    e) where you can calculate the nth digit in log(n) (or even polylog(n)) time? If so, then H(x) = digits[x
                    ... x+100] seems like it would be a cool cryptographic hash algo.</p>
                  <p>Now, I am by no means a detective, but by the sound of those tweets, the Proof-of-Work algorithm seems
                    to still be of utmost importance ... </p>

      <p class="firstparagraph">Last week and this week, the out-of-control handgun problem is in the news. This leads one to believe there is a problem with the <i>definition</i> of a gun. As always. Definitions start wars and world wars--after all of last century, did anyone decide who controls the Coal of Sudetenland?? You can bet everyone there speaks two languages, still. The <i>definitional </i> answer makes the answer: This is why Blockchain technology--straddled between myriad start-ups, countless institutions and a hundred brilliant minds is The answer to our scalability problems.   
      
      </p><p>The problem is that data structures grow at differential rates, some exponential, some linear, some slower, some as a function of time or other variable.  Yet, our data analysis needs are clear: We need a new technology to handle quickly, securely and efficiently the <i>Networked, Relational Data Problem</i>, which scales exponentially with traditional data structures, like old-fashioned Excel-like Row-&amp;-Column data structures. Yet, as one would logarithmize the equation to best adapt new data, so must the computer data structure adjust accordingly. </p>
      <p>Too rigid, the world turned to relational, non-Structured Query Language (SQL) data, partially for the need to dislate <i>data objects</i> from their tables. The world needed that cell as a free-radical in order to mimic the data structure of societally-networked society.  Alas, a science already at hard work with Cambridge Analytica--again what's that field of study called again, Sociology, right? </p>

Next, A.I. will make irrelevant fossil fuels by 2030, if not before; and those caught polluting would be fined to death, anyway. Without A.I., none of these worthwhile goals are possible. This precarious, difficult and most of all laborious job of designing our own solutions will take time: For this reason, Uber should be shamed even further for their short-cuts, and eventual errors of internal, organizational problems. <i>Uber's experiemental, tax-free "Testing Sandbox" cannot be the erstwhile safe neighborhoods of Surburban Phoenix, without proper caution.</i> </p>		
      <p>Are Uber's corporate desires, market stronghold, and shareholders' delight more worthwhile than <i>an entire sensitive field of machine-learning research?</i> No. Uber must be warned to not steal corporate secrets from Waymo, then proceed to be 86'd from California, then brush aside with excuses the <i>killing of an innocent Arizona bicyclist</i>.</p>
      <p>
      Who can count the number of very feisty taxi-men and -women that are not fans of the infamously hasty culture of Uber. The team of lawyers needed to be 86'd from France? Uber already knows, because maybe they know B.D.O!

      </h6>
      <p class="firstparagraph">A.I. generally, and specifically Uber's Self-Driving Tech, both have failed society this week. Although we could all debate the merits of "Lidar", i.e. laser-based vision, the primary concern, in my view, is Uber's obvious carelessness in rushing their self-driving tech.  Although six thousand (6,000 too many) pedestrians are killed in the U.S. annually, I'd only hope AI wouldn't add to the problem.<sup>2</sup> The Arizona victim was walking her bicycle when struck, and I as bike-commuter can't help but take the affair personally. </p>
      <p>This first human death is at least a <strong>big Wake-Up moment</strong> for the industry in its haste to roll out A.I. tech.  After all, Uber's questionable leadership morals<sup>2</sup> and being kicked out of San Francisco for running more than six red-lights raises eyebrows to begin with.<sup>3</sup> My problem with Uber is that the car's algorithm, with perfect Lidar vision, did not flinch or slow down for two seconds as it killed the victim. Humans flinch and humans swerve, because protecting fellow humans is in our DNA, not in A.I.'s. So, while we now know Uber's software hasn't caught up with its A.I.-Lidar hardware--let's hope we see defensive driving and some <i>TLC</i> programmed into those A.I. Algorithms!

      <h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Facebook Fiasco: Why Zuckerberg Should not have Dropped out of Harvard
      </h6>
      <p class="firstparagraph">
      Universities, private or public institutions, serve as a beacon for
      <strong>the Fearless Protection and Ethical Regulation</strong> of information and data. This is because data and data research
      is innate to the university's Mission Statement, whereas business and governmental institutions are relatively new
      to the game, and often at odds with the
      <i>Academy</i>, and occasionally against each other. </p>
      <p class="quote">Threats to student data privacy existed long before the internet. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover infiltrated Berkeley
      student groups to counter communism in the 1960s. Around the same time, the CIA manipulated the National Student
      Association for intelligence gathering in other anti-communism efforts. But the privacy issue is more acute now
      that the amount of student data in cloud-based systems has grown exponentially and is more widely dispersed.
      <sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p> The University's expertise over ethically regulated data collection and management, is better than government, business,
      and even medical domains for two reasons. First, the institution's long history and ethical motives with data are
      unique. The norms of data-handling have been codified through the University's Institutional Review Board based
      on its
      <strong>stated mission</strong>. In other words, Universities take data seriously
      <i>for reasons other than corporate profit or governmental control</i>. An example of personal data precautions has
      played out with Harvard's recent data tiffs leading to the Supreme Court, illustrated by a 2016 article: </p>
      <p class="quote">Last week undergraduates at Harvard University raised concerns about the institution handing over their data to an
      anti-affirmative action group as part of a lawsuit. Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing the university
      for allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants, will have access to “academic, extracurricular,
      demographic and other information” from all undergrads who applied to Harvard between the fall 2009 and spring 2015,
      omitting names and Social Security numbers.
      <sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The second reason why Universities understand ethical implications for data is that data and more broadly data and
      human information
      <i>research</i> is the institutions' second highest priority, along with teaching and service. For example, in response
      to the unethical Public Health research in
      <i>Tuskegee Syphilis experiements</i>, the University instution
      <i>stepped in</i> to help design the 1978
      <strong>Belmont Principles</strong>. Currently, the University Institutional Review Board incorporates this with the Nuremburg
      Code (developed after WWII NAZI research), in handling data research.
      </p>
      <p>In recent days,
      <i>private companies</i> claim expertise for regulating "Fake News", and you guessed it,
      <strong>regulation of data privacy &amp; confidentiality.</strong><sup>3</sup> The ethical authority over data privacy norms are nowhere
      else than the University campus, case in point Harvard... Let the governments govern and the enterprises enterprise,
      and leave the
      <i>thoughtful, ethical regulation of data collection and precaution </i> to the Ivory Tower. Corporate and Government
      self-regulation is opaque enough!</p>

      <h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A New Politics of Power:
      <br /> The Cryptographic Financial Escape Hatch
      </h6>
      <p>I had originally intended for a post on the very lamentable
      <i>Blockbuster-ization</i> and eventual demise of Toys-"R"-Us, but Tech Affairs happen too quickly! Instead ...</p>
      <p class="firstparagraph">Today, US inserted itself into a large, deep debate about crypto-legitimacy by imposing new sanctions on Venezuela.
      In case you hadn't heard, here's a quick recap:</p>
      <p class="quote">The administration’s announcement came a few hours after Mr. Trump signed an executive order barring the use of any
      digital currency issued by the Maduro government since Jan. 9. Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country
      had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation’s vast petroleum reserves.
      <br />
      <br />The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation
      of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation.
      <sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
      This turn of events, both Maduro et al.'s financial cleverness and Trump's action to de-legitimate the Petro crypto-currency,
      are examples of the undefined, near-limitless political uses for Blockchain Tech, both offensively and defensively.
      In fact, the ensuing events may be of great interest as we will witness a major first actual use-case of the decentralizing
      aims of crypto-technology tool. A tool that softens the financial leverage wielded by centralized authorities, whether
      governmental or private.
      </p>
      <p>I used the term "de-legitimate" above because there are two processes at work: First, crypto-currencies are
      <i>in themselves</i> not legitimate. A
      <strong>crypto-currency platform gains legitimacy through a series of both technical and financial trust-building stages</strong>.
      So legitimacy is earned first privately, and some currency platforms continue publicly to Initial Coin Offering,
      and so on--purely financial and technical legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>And then, there is the another kind of legitimacy, which involves political leverage ... </p>

      <h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come, Part II: A Ripple and an Iota of Sustainable Crypto-Currency
      </h6>
      <p class="firstparagraph">Iota and Ripple cryptocurrencies use different technology than traditional blockchain in order to achieve their distributed
      ledgers. Traditionally, outside "miners" validate the block's
      <i> transaction records</i> as it replicates to the next "block." For example, a transaction is validated 2 or three
      times, and since three miners' validations all agree, one is kept and two are destroyed, in a nutshell; one example
      of computations (
      <strong>and hence coal</strong>) that cost too much time and energy.</p>
      <p>Unlike this arrangement, Iota, Ripple, and Hedera use a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) data structure (shaped like
      a sideways genealogy tree) that relies on "consensus" from its nearest neighbor transaction nodes.
      <sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Enough with the jargon! The bottom line is that Bitcoin's tech is not eco-sustainable,
      <sup>2</sup> and so alternatives are already closing in on Bitcoin. Iota, the 8th largest cryptocurrency Iota delivers
      open-source transparency, lightning speed, and yet is it cryptographically sound? Not according to some tech pundits:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">You might think that IOTA, a cryptocurrency worth over a billion dollars, and working with organizations like Microsoft,
      University College London, Innogy, and Bosch, BNY Mellon, Cisco, and Foxconn (through the Trusted IOT Alliance)
      would not have fairly obvious vulnerabilities, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. When we took a look at their
      system, we found a serious vulnerability and textbook insecure code.
      <br />
      <br /> “In 2017, leaving your crypto algorithm vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis is a rookie mistake. It says that
      no one of any calibre analyzed their system, and that the odds that their fix makes the system secure is low,” states
      Bruce Schneier, renowned security technologist, about IOTA when we shared our attack.
      <sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>And so, with a 1.9 billion market cap, I sometimes have to reflect on the immensity and non-relational fact and figures
      of our technological world! Security and other bugs are hard to avoid when an industry is moving too fast for thoroughly
      tested betas; and each iteration involves a series of bug-patches, with short- and long-term priorities stretched
      with new design &amp; function trade-offs.</p>
      <p>
      Full life-cycle software development, from napkin-idea to rolling specs, always follows these patterns yet not always with
      so much money on the line! Here's a closer look at one critique of Iota:</p>
      <p class="quote">
      IOTA developers had written their own hash function, it was a huge red flag ... I think it’s important to reiterate that
      the IOTA developers do not agree with our characterization of this as an issue of concern. Our report lays out more
      details about why we are concerned.
      <br />
      <br /> There are other red flags — unlike every other program running on your laptop or phone, IOTA uses ternary instead
      of binary. Since all computer hardware today uses binary, IOTA converts to ternary in software, which is less efficient
      and more complex. This complexity prevents IOTA from benefiting from existing security analysis tools that are designed
      to work with binary, and makes the code harder to read and understand.
      <br />
      <br /> The current IOTA tangle requires a trusted party (the coordinator) for security, suggesting that in its current
      form it’s not ready to run as a truly permissionless, decentralized system.
      <sup>3</sup>
      </p><p>
      Optimizing, not sacrificing, should be the name of the game as Tech closes in on Blockchain challenges of security, scalability,
      and that evers-so-costly

      <p class="firstparagraph">Sustainability for the environment means an accelerated transition to renewables. While other nations have undertaken
      big steps toward wind and solar - even China's pollution declined in 2014 for the first time
      <sup>1</sup>. EU is now 30% renewable--from 12% in 2000 to expected 50% renewable energy by 2030
      <sup>2</sup>. Us, it appears, not so much...ouch.</p>
      <p>What can we do then, in our lives, to make our own contribution. Well, besides less fossil fuels and red meat, we
      can choose our cryptocurrencies more conscientiously. One NY town's recent actions echo my own concerns about the
      enormous carbon footprint of "Proof-of-Work" blockchain mining.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
      The city of Plattsburgh has put a moratorium on cryptocurrency mining to preserve natural resources, the health of its residents
      and the city’s “character and direction,” officials said after a public hearing Thursday. For 18 months, the 20,000-resident
      city will not consider new applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining. Violators will face fines of up to
      $1,000 for each day they defy the moratorium.

      <p>So, me too - count me out, I can't help but do the same, and pronounce my own refrain from Bitcoin (this is more
      spiritual since I don't own, nor mine). In contrast, I'll put Ethereum on hold since they are transitioning to a
      zero carbon-footprint by year's end. </p>
      <p>And, for the most environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies, I wholly support Ripple (3rd highest valued cryptocurrency)
      and also clean
      <i>Iota</i> (8th highest valued )
      <sup>5</sup>. Ripple, unfortunately, is a private company with a less-accessible internal distributed ledger. And yet,
      Hedera Hashgraph heralds the most optimistic news of all: A blindlingly fast Hashgraph structure, unbound from any
      carbon footprint.

      While [Taylor Swift] is certainly making money in retail sales and digital downloads, both of those metrics are spiraling

      in the music industry’s continuing debate over streaming music. </p>
      <p class="quote">
      It has been hailed as a potential savior through a two-tiered “freemium” model that would gradually lure listeners away from
      piracy. Yet Spotify’s royalty rates have also terrified many artists already worried that each new step in music’s
      digital evolution further devalues their work.
      <sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>So the trend looks dire, and yet is it really? Where, just where are the
      <strong>Tech Platforms </strong> leading us? Tech is leading us
      <i>nowhere</i>, at least not to one
      <strong>singular, centralized place</strong>; rather, decentralized tech--including but not limited to blockchain--is busy
      rewriting the boundaries between creators and consumers. This Tuesday's Forbes article reported on new subscription-based
      model by Patreon. Still classical Web 2.0, it's novelty appears so simple, almost intuitive in potentially new pathway:</p>
      <p class="quote">"On Kickstarter and Indiegogo, creators essentially have to start over every time," says Danny Rimer, a partner at
      Index Ventures who is a Patreon investor and board member. "It's the same reason software companies went from licensed
      software to subscriptions: predictable revenue and better service for customers."
      <sup>4</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
      Apparently Patreon, along with last November's
      <i>Drip</i> by KickStarter have made headway. Patreon paid out $150 million to its artists in 2017, and each are doubling
      annually. Decentralizing again. Well, we say we can't
      <i>go back to the way it was</i>, but Tech always seems to lead us back to the way it was!

      <i>Tou
        <strong>Demou</strong> tes
        <strong> Krates</strong>
      </i>:
      <br />Strength of the People</h6>
      
      <p class="firstparagraph">Today's demonstrations and walk-outs, led by America's Youth and followed by many of the education staff, has aimed
      directly at Gun-Control legislation. Yet, the message more powerfully articulated than ever by adolescent-turns-adult
      students, takes aim at something further afield. </p>
      <p>Students, remembering the February 14th massacre victims, take aim at the corruption stemming from the 2010 Supreme
      Court "Person-hood" protection for Corporations, also known as the
      <i>Citizens United</i> Decision. A dated, but poignant, article from National Public Radio explains:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">The Supreme Court extended that protection to corporations, and over time also extended some — but not all — of the
      rights guaranteed to individuals in the Bill of Rights.
      <sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
      Yet, it appears deceptively harmless for Congressional Law-makers to protect corporations, in the form of
      <strong>Gun Manufacturers' Lobbyists, </strong>
      as equally as it protects humans. The origin or this ruling dates to a 70's Neo-Liberal, right-leaning legislation and Court
      rulings that include a pivotal 1978
      <i>First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti</i> decision allowing for corporations' ballot-initiative campaign contributions,
      citing the First Amendment.
      <sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
      
      The Result? The corporation, in "person" form, takes on Pseudo-Human qualities: immortal, beyond-measure capital, and programmatically
      serving stock-holders' interests with cut-throat competition at all costs. No match against a sympathetic human,
      yet the Corporation is given the same rights and privileges as the man in the street. Now, in the face of two decades'
      dead humans--as young as
      <i>Sandy Hook Elementary</i>, which were not protected by Legislation, due to commitments made to corporate lobbying.
      </p>
      <p>It appears increasingly difficult for Marco Rubio to accept money from gun lobbyists
      <i>in exchange</i> for executing their legislation demands. As I mentioned in my
      <a href="#18-02-14">February 14th post</a> on the topic, it is clear a generation is awakening: And, the Humans have begun to revolt
      against the
      <strong>Heavily-Armed Lobbying Machines!

      <h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:
      <br /> Part III and Sustainability of Shared, Distributed Ledger Types</h6>
      
      <p class="firstparagraph">March 13th, 2018 marks the day that certain types of blockchain technologies, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, face
      an existential crisis: Today, a new distributed ledger technology has been announced, which departs from the traditional
      "Proof-of-Work" (energy-intensive calculations) Blockchain technologies. This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint.
      For example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore's 49.8!</p>
      <p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to
      <i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking:
      Denial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot),
      so the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle. </p>
      <p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly,
      this is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950's (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating
      system. </p>
      <p>
      Next, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of "fairness" because blockchain transactions are
      <i>
        <strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i> Bitcoin transactions are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle,
      which is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p>
      <p>
      Swirld's unveiled their consensus-based
      <strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has now been announced to
      deploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news! Tremendous, since I explained
      in my
      <a href="#18-03-01">March 1st </a> blog post that older blockchain technologies incentivize miners' efforts by directly tying electrical-cost(
      (in calculations) to the Bitcoin/hour profit margin. For this reason, the future horizon just considerably shortened
      Bitcoin's runway for establishing anything beyond "early-adopter" status. </p>
      <p>So, we'll see if the innovating crew with Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum can successfully alter the crypto algorithm
      into it's planned carbon-free consensus-based, "proof-of-stake" form. For the moment, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other
      electricity-draining "proof-of-work" designs, have their
      <strong>exchange value trapped inside their own Carbon Footprint</strong>.
      <sup>4</sup> And so, because environmental sustainablity is foremost of concerns for future investment, survival may
      depend on digging out of that Carbon Footprint much more quickly!</p>

      <br /> Part II and New Forms of Trust</h6>
      <p class="firstparagraph">
      Throughout the centralized-tech period of the
      <i>mobile-powered </i> Web 2.0, most Sharing transactions take place on a centralized platform that simply facilitates
      the peer-to-peer transactions. However, the trust is based on some third-party authority. For instance, Uber serves
      as the centralalized, third-party authority between both consumers (whether resource-obtaining or resource-providing)
      must place their trust. Similarly, centralized authorities like Paypal, etc. enable peer-to-peer collaboration.
      Yet, the notion of trust remains unsolved: Both parties must place their faith in the third party. By definition,
      this problem that undermines the
      <i>Sharing Economy</i> is resolved by Blockchain technologies, through cryptography. Now, Decentralized Apps (DAPPS)
      provide a truer sharing platform for value transactions.
      </p>
      <p>In short, neither peer,
      <strong>neither consumer needs to be trusted, because both parties share a mutual trust in their shared ledger</strong>
      (think of a thick book with an indexed log of each and every transaction, with unchangeable entries etched by cryptography.
      In this fashion the forms of Exchange Value include:
      <br /> 1. Value Funds &amp; Investments
      <br /> 2. Immutable Insurance &amp; Risk Management
      <br /> 3. Account for &amp; Audit Commodified Value 4. Authenticate &amp; Attest to Value
      <br /> 5. Transfer, Store, Lend Value

      <br /> Part I and the Race for Sustainability Solutions</h6>
      
      <p class="firstparagraph">Sharing can be a philosophy and even an ideology, but it is also
      <strong> a concept sewn into the Technology of the Era</strong>. Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer
      marketplaces,
      <i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer
      of resources. By either sense, the
      <i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media,
      internet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>
      
      <p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s
      <i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods
      and services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>
      
      <p>In
      <i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how
      the
      <strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>.
      <sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3) breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general
      purpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power,
      sources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>
      
      <p>The first condition: New forms of communication to
      <i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second
      condition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition:
      New methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>
      
      <p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving
      solar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated,
      driverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new
      technology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>
      
      <p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s
      innovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in
      the present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively
      the New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>
      
      <p>So, how can we change the way we
      <i>think</i> and how we
      <i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on
      <strong>
        <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i>
      </strong>
      <sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will
      a New Paradigm Shift emerge. In this occasion however, we as a society may not have the luxury of decades to adapt
      to New Technologies, as the carbon hangover from the previous Industrial Era imperils the safe arrival of the next!</p>

      shape our future institutions. This means that every institution, whether private hospitals, non-profit charity
      foundations, or government bureaus, will effectively restructure (optimize) their own organizational structure in
      an increasingly
      <i>data-driven</i> paradigm. From a Sociology of Organizations perspective, the changes to come are breath-taking to
      consider.</p>
      
      <p>So why women? Where could I start? Better stated, why is a quintessentially important job sector, a sector in desperate
      need for insight, comprised primarily of men?
      <sup id="one">1</sup> The facts are evident: ~15-20% of women comprising tech positions.
      <sup id="two">2</sup> Numbers aside, I argue there is a quintessential societal need for more women in tech: This is because computing
      and understanding data has changed since the data collection from Web 2.0 (mobile), becoming more networked and
      relational.</p>
      
      <p>The challenge for society in this age is historic, and women must absolutely be included in the process of the age:
      Please consider, that in the 1650&#39;s, the invention of the microscope opened a new world of data and
      <i>information</i> about the bacteriological, microscopic surroundings--hitherto blind to all. Likewise, the telescope
      has allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>
      
      <p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage)
      a universe of knowledge--about
      <i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the
      data to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the
      <i>output</i> can be
      <i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the
      key challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>
      
      <p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables. This is akin
      to finding a needle in an increasingly complex and growing haystack.</p>
      
      <p class="quote">What&#39;s different now and has changed is it&#39;s no longer about taking this data, putting it into a computer
      running a calculation and getting a balance sheet answer ...</p>
      
      <p class="quote">What&#39;s important now is what is the context of the data, what is it connected to, what effect is it having on
      data around it... It&#39;s basically a network of the data, it&#39;s no longer sort of tabular columns, of rows
      of data, it&#39;s
      <i>interconnected patterns</i>.
      <br /> --Tim Cook</p>
      
      <p>This quote means that as we move away from rule-based, mechanistic data analytics toward more complex, relational
      and networked data, we need an equally complex paradigm to keep up. Excluding the female mind from this challenge
      is not simply a clumsy, myopic mistake. Worse yet, so long as the Tech Industry remains gender lop-sided, Tech will
      increasingly resemble another myopic beast, a cave-dweller named Cyclops.</p>

      <p class="firstparagraph">Net Neutrality Rules, potentially one of the more important set of Individual Rights for us as citizens in the tech
      age, will soon undergo the rule changes voted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) this past December.
      In a nutshell, the Internet Service Providers (ISP&#39;s), e.g. Comcast, Cox, Verizon are granted the power--as
      a Title I &quot;information service&quot;--to slow down traffic, make fast- &amp; slow-lanes. Of course this is
      bad news for internet-users because even premium users may experience &quot;throttling&quot; if using the ISP&#39;s
      preferred apps. The only stipulation holds that the ISP&#39;s rules are made public. However, 21 states are bringing
      lawsuits to fight these changes, and the first assertion of State Law by Washington State today:</p>
      
      <p class="quote">The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback of net neutrality rules, including
      an effort from 21 state attorneys general to get a court to block the FCC&#39;s move.</p>
      
      <p class="quote">&quot;This is symbolic politics, because the states know it is illegal to do,&quot; Roslyn Layton, a visiting scholar
      at the American Enterprise Institute, told NBC News. &quot;But they can put rules on the book and make it look like
      they&#39;re doing something.&quot; The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback

      <h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel: Part II and the Germs</h6>
      
      <p class="firstparagraph">Germs present a timely topic for today, given the especially virulent
      <strong>Flu Virus strain</strong>. Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era
      <sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any
      medical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39;
      surface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively,
      and provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics
      are
      <i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>
      
      <p class="quote">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating
      strains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies
      relied on a misleading methodology.</p>
      
      <p class="quote">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations
      in the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which
      manufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while
      it is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains.
      <sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu
      virus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu
      <i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with
      <i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>
      
      <p class="quote">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses
      that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that
      are pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic
      tree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system
      exposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond
      <sup>2</sup>.</p>
      
      <p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular
      period each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal
      time-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>
      
      <p class="quote">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further
      away on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses.
      <sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a
      <i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also
      provides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain
      math can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort
      of.</p>
      
      <p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each
      other, then conditional upon other factors. This being
      <i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e
      things: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any
      <i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions
      about a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>
      
      <p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our
      sciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The
      first of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of
      which gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>
      
      <p>
      The third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating
      <i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better
      handle on the multiple effects of
      <sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large
      Numbers
      <sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new
      <strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the
      <i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician
      out there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!

      <h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel</h6>
      
      <p class="firstparagraph">Back in 1997, a Pulitzer-Prize winning theory--based on Dr. Jared Diamond&#39;s
      <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies</i> --provided the recipe book for the success of societies.
      Not without controversy, the theory posits that geographic and environmental preconditions, once met, provide tech
      &amp; resources trading opportunities, within a network of other nation-states also vying for technogical innovation.</p>
      
      <p>A nation&#39;s Technology, in turn, opens the means necessary to expansive, stable, independent sovereignty that
      lasts and thrives. Equally so, the nation&#39;s friends, especially those making the best-friends list, share and
      receive a secondary, &quot;residual&quot; technological bump over the time-course of the network&#39;s future trading,
      i.e. network transactions. So, if our best friends Canada and Mexico are less keen, then there is network reverberation!</p>
      
      <p>Given the advent of a real, lasting Trade-War, I would think that a network theorist wouldn&#39;t be betting on one
      particular node within this network. I say this because a disproportionately asymmetrical flow of technology and
      resources, while simultaneously raising prices on most staple goods, may spell trouble for the Every-Day person.
      So far, Nation-State: 0, People: 0 ... So, who wins with a Trade War? Alas, let&#39;s hope not the resurrection
      of the Neo-Multi-National Corporations, born from NAFTA deals, coincidentally, from the late 1990&#39;s. Bah humbug!</p>

      <p class="firstparagraph">Security, security, another day another platform risk, or risks from your device, or risks from transactions, Today&#39;s
      headline buried beneath a techy jargon provides a glimpse of the rising threat of web-application-based hackery:
      Cryptojacking.
      <i>Coindesk</i> reports, &quot; Opera browser introduces cryptocurrency miner protection for smartphones ... &quot;</p>
      
      <p class="quote">Cryptocurrency miners can overload smartphones&#39; CPUs, forcing 100 percent usage and potentially causing a phone
      to overheat. And the damage can sometimes be permanent. According to a ZDNet article, one trojan generated so much
      heat in a phone, its battery became swollen, permanently damaging the phone. While excessive ads were one reason
      for the heat generation, the main cause was that the phone&#39;s CPU was hijacked to mine for Monero.
      <sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>The larger issue here is that the lines between trusted mobile-app authorities, i.e., certified by Play Store or
      Apple&#39;s is increasingly irrelevent. This is because an increasing number of app-users are ditching device-downloaded
      apps, preferring for browser applications--hence, a much more appetizing market for the newest generation of blackhat
      hackers, online thieves, peeping-toms, and other ill-wishers. There are a few driving factors for this issue--one
      of which is the onset of Decentralized Applications (DAPPs), which use the
      <i>browser</i> to interface between the Every-Day blockchain client/merchant/programmer and the actual byte-code of
      the blockchain (via WEB).</p>
      
      <p>More importantly, the larger issue is that we live in an age in which the exclusive, native browser language since
      1995, i.e. JavaScript. Security issues with browser-based apps were very low, because JavaScript never left the
      browser, ever. Until 2009, Data, Servers were the domain of PHP, JAVA, Python, etc. or some other language for the
      highly sensitive, dirty work of dipping into all that data sitting ontop of centralized servers around the world.
      PHP wasn&#39;t easy, so power and responsibility usually followed with all the extra effort and expertise.</p>
      
      <p>2015 augured in the Node.js server-accessing (can create, read, update, and delete date) new-born capabilities of

      <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Blockchain Sustainability Issues and The Double-Edged Sword</h6>
      
      <p class="firstparagraph">I couldn&#39;t help but revisit the
      <strong>Environmental Sustainability</strong> problem I addressed in my February 28th post. This problem, experienced by
      the top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the
      <i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the
      <i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity KiloWatt Hours
      per year.
      <sup>1</sup> Digiconomist succinctly writes:</p>
      
      <p class="quote">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a
      solid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years
      this has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of
      the currency reached new highs.
      <sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>And, so the issue I&#39;m addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more
      equipment, and in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin&#39;s surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year
      usage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per year, respectively.
      In other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner&#39;s cost (in electricity) compared with the miner&#39;s gain (in
      Bitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper Carbon Footprint.</p>
      
      
      <p class="quote">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin network has
      been increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start of November 2017, the Bitcoin
      Energy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network to be half of the
      current amount. On the first day of November, the estimated consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year.
      <sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Carbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner&#39;s electricity costs account for approximately
      65% of the profit (Bitcoin units&#39; value, measured when mined). So the
      <i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost
      of the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the
      <i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then
      perhaps the other edge looks preferred!
