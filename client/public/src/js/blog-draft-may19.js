<p class="firstparagraph">Satoshi Nakamoto, the omni-present legend that introduced the final frontier for Trustless-based cryptocurrencies is worthy of the world's respect. But the Prying Eyes of the tech paparazzi are on the attack. <br /><br />Some character development:  
</p>

<p </p>
 

<p class="quote"> Ten years ago today, someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto sent an academic paper to a cryptography mailing list proposing a form of digital cash called "bitcoin." The pseudonymous Nakamoto, whose true identity remains unknown, described an idea for "mining" a limited amount of this virtual currency through a peer-to-peer scheme that wouldn't depend on a bank, government, or any other central authority. Once people started using bitcoin, it would be impossible for a government to pull the plug, as happened with previous attempts to create digital money, such as E-Gold.
<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>However, seeking a life of anonymity can only stir up further the paparazzis' research fervor. So, the latest attempt on the inventor's privacy, there is the latest claim:</p>
<p class="quote">The Gotsatoshi.com domain was registered in May 2017, but has lain dormant until last month, when an archived snapshot of the site shows it to have been proclaiming Satoshi’s unveiling as 10 days away then. It’s possible that the great reveal will remain forever 10 days away, to frustrate watchers hoping for a thrilling denouement, or the countdown may reach zero only to reveal a new shitcoin, puzzle game, or to hail the efforts of the marketing agency that dreamed up the stunt.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p><i></i>
Channeling our adoration of Satoshi Nakamoto toward respect is a bygone hope, but unwarranted paparazzi expos&eacute;s cross the line of decency, so let's see if Satoshi's cleverness yet once again thwarts the prying eyes!

    <p class="firstparagraph">Rekognition, a premier AWS service, shines among a few dozen other AI software resources, not to mention Platforms-as-a-Service, yet not without controversy: On the one hand, AI algorithms necessarily reflect the biases of its origin lab. On the other hand, Providers like AWS' democratizing access to every researcher, professional, and student the unlimited use of sophisticated and expensive AI resources; thus canceling out any potential bias through the diversity of individuals' and teams' participation.

    At the heart of these healthy public debates, it's the particular use-cases that exemplify the spectrum of the debate. For instance, policing practice by bot is a sure example, if not for the <i>RoboCop</i> Hollywood allure ... As always, the AI's algorithm bears the imprint of the creator's intentions: </p>
	
	<p class="quote"> 
	But Washington County also became ground zero for a high-stakes battle over the unregulated growth of policing by algorithm. Defense attorneys, artificial-intelligence researchers and civil rights experts argue that the technology could lead to the wrongful arrest of innocent people who bear only a resemblance to a video image. Rekognition’s accuracy is also hotly disputed, and some experts worry that a case of mistaken identity by armed deputies could have dangerous implications, threatening privacy and people’s lives.<br /><br />

Some police agencies have in recent years run facial-recognition searches against state or FBI databases using systems built by contractors such as Cognitec, IDEMIA and NEC. But the rollout by Amazon has marked perhaps the biggest step in making the controversial face-scanning technology mainstream. Rekognition is easy to activate, requires no major technical infrastructure, and is offered to virtually anyone at bargain-barrel prices. Washington County spent about $700 to upload its first big haul of photos, and now, for all its searches, pays about $7 a month.<sup>1</sup>

    <p class="firstparagraph">Ethereum Ether and Bitcoin have plenty in common, including their Proof-of-Work architecture--requiring Mining computationally difficult math problems to create scarcity and other functions. The downside is the nation-comparable amount of electricity spent each year, which in many cases are unregulated, coal-filled energy sources across the globe. This commonality will end next month when the Ethereum cryptocurrency will transition to Proof-of-Stake architecture, the long-ago and highly anticipated Ethereum 2.0.
    </p>
     
    
    <p class="quote"> 
    Ethereum has been inching toward a major upgrade, dubbed ethereum 2.0, which would radically change the how the $17 billion network creates blocks and verifies transactions. As explained by founder of ethereum Vitalik Buterin in a recent interview at ethereum conference ETHCapetown, ethereum 2.0 has “two major flagship components.”
    <br /><br />
    “One is Casper, which is our proof-of-stake algorithm which replaces mining…with something that we consider to be much more efficient,” Buterin said at the time. “The second part is sharding which is this massive scalability improvement which happens because you don’t need every computer in the network to process every transaction in the network any more.
    <br /><br />
    Buterin added that with sharding, he anticipates a “1,000 factor increase in scalability” to the network. However, sharding will only come in the later two phases of ethereum 2.0 roll-out. The first phase – dubbed Phase Zero – strictly launches ethereum’s new proof-of-stake blockchain.
    <sup>1.</sup>
    </p>
    
    <p>The second improvement accentuates Ethereum's contract-capable currency (unlike Bitcoin's lack of contractual functionality), which means to revolutionize not only how data is persisted but also distributed, and managed at the individualized crypto-level! Using a language called <i>Solidity</i>, derived from Java and JavaScript origins, this crypto-currency stands first in line for upsetting the existing systems of finance, manufacture, and enterprise data. An exemple use-case ...

    <p class="quote"> 
    In the United States, healthcare comes from a patchwork of private companies, which means the handling of patient data is even more fragmented. John Halamka, chief information officer at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, told MIT Technology Review last year that there are 26 different electronic medical records systems in his home city alone.
    <br /><br />
    In 2016, Halamka teamed up with a group of scientists at MIT to try to find a solution to the problem using blockchain. They published their white paper on the subject in August 2016, laying out their proposal for a system that would help all those disparate databases exchange data — a project they called MedRec.
    <br /><br />
    Andy Lippman, a senior research scientist at MIT, co-authored the paper with Halamka. The system they outlined was to use Ethereum software — which, unlike bitcoin, can integrate and execute smart contracts — to build a private blockchain, linking healthcare providers together and allowing them to share their data.

    <p>So, as usual, Ethereum wins the day for both daily applicability and now a more scalable <strong><i>and</i> conscientious</strong> crypto-currency Tech!

  <p class="firstparagraph">Data Analytics' <i>Law of Large Numbers</i>, i.e. over n = 10,000, promises a predictable likelihood of conditions and events, given a sufficiently high sample of training data. Despite the quantum-directed molecular behavior of biological organisms, the classical exponentiation of machine-learning statistical algorithms still does work miracles:  
  </p>
   
   
  
  <p class="quote"> 
  Studies indicate that using algorithms to analyze digital slides delivers diagnoses as accurate as an expert pathologist—and in some instances, the algorithms are more accurate. A 2018 study by Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT found that an automated system they developed diagnosed dense breast tissue (an indicator of breast cancer) in mammograms at the same level as an expert radiologist. Another algorithm developed by Google was found to “help detect metastatic breast cancers with significant accuracy and improve pathologist performance,” according to studies in the Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the American Journal of Surgical Pathology.
  </p>
  So, how can we best take advantage of these advances? Clear the brush! The meta-organization of healthcare technology and financing simply can't keep pace with the pure tech:
  <p class="quote">
  After taking a look, the pathologist might ship it to a specialist at another lab for a second opinion. Each time the slide is moved, it is packed up and shipped to a different address. All the while, you’re waiting days or even weeks to hear whether or not you have cancer.
<br /><br />
  For decades, there have been limited ways to share medical slides, with information management lagging behind even as medical science advanced. But in the past few years, a new industry of digital pathology has emerged that could finally offer a more efficient and large-scale way of distributing and analyzing these kinds of samples.
  <sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>So, the good news from <i>the doctors'</i> occasional nemesis, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, decided that after 8 years of trials and hearings, truly scalable and sufficiently large sample data can now be digitized - hence personalizing the law of large numbers from the whole to the individual patient. At long last, the patience has paid off!
