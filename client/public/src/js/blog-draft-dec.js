  Amid the wreckage of the burst bitcoin bubble  it is fair to assess the outlook for blockchains, the technology underlying the cryptocurrency. There’s a difference. Blockchains, it is said, stand to revolutionize enterprise technology by addressing the problems with authentication and identity at the heart of the internet itself, eliminating middle layers in transactions and making it faster and easier to establish provenance.
  
  The adoption of blockchains in the enterprise has been slow. The question now is the extent to which the overblown investment thesis behind bitcoin and related financial mania can be separated from the utility of blockchain as a tool in enterprise technology.

  <p class="quote">Formally, an asset bubble is just a rapid rise and abrupt crash in prices. Defenders of the efficient-market theory argue that these price movements are based on changes in investor’s beliefs about an asset’s true value. But it’s hard to identify a reason why any rational investor would have so abruptly revised her assessment of the long-term earnings power of companies in 1929, or the long-term viability of dot-com startups in 2000, or the long-term value of housing in 2007.
<br /><br />
  Similarly, there was no obvious reason why it made sense for the world to believe that Bitcoin was the currency of the future late December 2017, but to think this was less than one fifth as likely today. Bitcoin wasn’t eclipsed by a competitor — the main alternative cryptocurrencies had even bigger price declines. Nor have regulators cracked down on Bitcoin — in fact, the regulatory structure has generally been quite accommodating to the technology. Nor have critical technological flaws emerged — yes, the Bitcoin network has become congested, but this problem was anticipated well before the crash. 
  
<br /><br />
  Instead, it seems overwhelmingly likely that Bitcoin’s spectacular rise and fall was due not to rational optimism followed by sensible pessimism, but to some kind of aggregate market irrationality — a combination of herd behavior, cynical speculation and the entry into the market of a large number of new, poorly informed investors.

  <p class="firstparagraph">Crypto-Currency theorists provide endless explanations over the disproportionately-sized fall of Bitcoin from December 2017 yet offer an incomplete picture. The more fascinating questions surround Bitcoin's 2017 growth rather than the interruption that either cascaded to new factors or simply magnified existing factors--such as security doubts and the dearth micro-economic public use.
  </p>
  <p class="quote"> His explanation for the divergence include last year’s meteoric rally, a “meltdown” in the macroeconomic climate and treasury sales during initial coin offerings. 
  “Fair value is significantly higher than the current price of Bitcoin,” he wrote. “In fact, working backwards, to solve for the current price of Bitcoin, this implies crypto wallets should fall to 17 million from 50 million currently.”

  <p class="firstparagraph">Leaving the age of personal pc computing power, the growing trends are to borrow someone else's computing power in the cloud. Platform-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, and other shared computing and storage services are merely aligning with the growing convention to spurn buying--say a car--in favor of renting for when and what needs specifically arise--like Uber, Turo and other peer-to-peer trends.  It only makes sense that Cloud services would incorporate more hardware customization and flexibility.

  <p class="quote">Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer and largest cloud-computing company, is pushing into a new line of work: computer chips.

  Late last month, the company, based in Seattle, revealed that it had spent the last few years building a new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world.
  
  Amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers, but the decision by one of the world’s biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do-it-yourself route is likely to have a major impact on Intel, the iconic Silicon Valley chip maker.

</p><p>Time-traveling to the dawn of the PC era, it must have felt the world ending with the monopolistic overtones of IBM and Microsoft. Yet, time--and technology--passes all things. Now, it is the age of Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services--including the chip!

  </p>
  <p class="quote">By the end of the mission in 2009, Anandakrishnan and his colleagues had collected data from about 150 boreholes. The new information didn’t precisely explain what was hastening Thwaites’ acceleration, but it was a start. Meanwhile, the satellite maps kept getting redder and redder. In 2014, Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at NASA, concluded that Thwaites was entering a state of “unstoppable” collapse. Even worse, scientists were starting to think that its demise could trigger a larger catastrophe in West Antarctica, the way a rotting support beam might lead to the toppling not only of a wall but of an entire house. Already, Thwaites’ losses were responsible for about 4 percent of global sea-level rise every year. When the entire glacier went, the seas would likely rise by a few feet; when the glaciers around it did, too, the seas might rise by more than a dozen feet.

  Workplace satisfaction sits squarely on finding purpose, usually to the aim of helping others. 20th century jobs plainly reflected this value in plain sight, however new jobs do the same and more, but less evidently. Code writing is worthy for its contributions to humanity--as much as bridge-building, nursing,  social work and any  industry.  Yet, software engineering is seen through the filter of coding, math,   logic and automation, instead of the true portraiture of the careful reflection, humanity and patience of coding authorship. Sadly, there is no PR to tout the new paradigm and lofty meaning tied into programming work! </p> 

  <p class="quote">Lack of career growth or trajectory was the biggest reason, with 28.1% of respondents saying it caused them to quit. Many of the women also believe that men have an advantage in the field; just 53% said women have the same opportunities to enter senior leadership roles as their male counterparts.<br />

  “Lack of career growth is a problem that women face across industries,” says Kim Williams, Indeed’s senior director of design platform, technology, and operations.

  <p class="firstparagraph">Competition versus cooperation with China presents an unanswerable question while nationalism brushes aside a common humanity--as far as technological advancement is concerned. Perhaps the best hope for a common thread of peace lies in the age-old, border-breaking legacy of 1990s' pre-tech wave multinationalist corporations--an impossible dream in the age of retributive tariff and trade threats ...

  <p class="quote">Yet the trade conflict that matters most between America and China is a 21st-century fight over technology. It covers everything from artificial intelligence (ai) to network equipment. The fundamental battleground is in semiconductors. The chip industry is where America’s industrial leadership and China’s superpower ambitions clash most directly. And whatever Messrs Trump and Xi say at the g20, this conflict will outlast them both.

  <p class="quote"> Invented four decades ago by 3M in what has become a famous example of mistakes leading to success, sticky notes have become a classic because of some unique properties. They can convey a message—that is, content—but their placement provides context. They can be put in the line of sight of someone to grab attention or be affixed to a document or other object to provide instruction or commentary. Their ability to be attached again and again has made them popular for arranging ideas on surfaces such as whiteboards for analog mind-mapping.
