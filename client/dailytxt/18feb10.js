                  <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Why are Sociologists now the Key Players in Data Analysis within the Domain of Blockchain Technologies?</h6>















                  <p class="firstparagraph">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin
                    and other cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology
                    (peer-to-peer global ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate,
                    individual needs and uses. These blockchain "network" analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network
                    changes, node changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly
                    or not. </p>



                  <p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships)
                    that include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain
                    tech must face analytical challenges that arise from informal practices
                    <sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role's protocol
                    for the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>















                  <p> Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan's (1977)
                    <i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple
                    <i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time,
                    convenience, etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm
                    human understanding
                    <i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of
                    a bank, a person, or a company's internal bot? </p>



                  <p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought
                    the world the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can only contribute little on how to interface
                    with social needs. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the
                    multi-dimensional layers of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks? Well
                    enough to differentiate qualitative meaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.















                  </p>







                  <p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved,
                    integrated through multiple layers of "middlemen", such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions,
                    non-governmental, non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases
                    the middlemen. Suddenly, one programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract,
                    that last month an entire team of hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing
                    different facets of this same thing. </p>



                  <p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the
                    life of the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years' Sociology Network
                    Analysts' research and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and
                    should not turn to the Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already
                    at home, safe within the academic domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and
                    so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology can either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances,
                    accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises. Or, the next ten years can follow Sociology's
                    Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful future. </p>







                  <p>















                    Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on review
                    of the Sociologists' specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships,
                    within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships.
                    We Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary,
                    yet are characterized by fixed patterns. </p>



                  <p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes
                    that characterize societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large
                    Number Statistical Theory become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900's Sociological French Network
                    Theories, like Maurice Halbswach's work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society's Collective
                    Memory.
                  </p>







                  <p>







                    No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic's "irrational behaviors"
                    and Mathematical "complexity models" do not
                    <i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate
                    simultaneous node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/
                    only 3 of 15 network groups get jobs), and most importantly the
                    <i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time
                    and fixed. </p>







                  <p>Fine. So, why is Sociology's network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th
                    and 20th centuries' network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era,
                    while </strong> North American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960's [post-1968],
                    U.S. in the 1990's[post-1999], in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of
                    past sociology are inherently small-data and more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates
                    "human-ness" into the billion rows and columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>







                  <p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation
                    for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of
                    each relationship (link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or
                    is changed; with this, it is possible to isolate directional, conditional
                    <i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation
                    <sup id="9one">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on
                    social networks. </p>







                  <p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person
                    <i>self-selects</i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group's
                    behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group's
                    behavior, by the group's influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder's SIENA software,
                    achieves the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology.
                    The network graph can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety
                    without hard forks), not as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary
                    assumptions that a set of nodes (social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are
                    known - except perhaps for a moderate amount of missing data</p>







                  <p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear,
                    directed path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists
                    are called upon, blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again
                    the same bugs. Sadly, this semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain
                    for their currency, contract, and other societal needs--in this case, the blind will indeed lead the
                    blind. </p>
