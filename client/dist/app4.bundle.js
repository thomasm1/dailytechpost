Though I was there for a Sociology PhD, I still got to get involved like any technology groupie would...  The rock-star out there is Universit&eacute de Montr&eacute;al\'s Dr. Yoshua Bengio,<sup>3</sup> who explains the consciousness elements of A.I, and how those compare with our own representations:\n  </p>\n  <p class="quote">\n  With supervised learning, humans provide the high-level concepts that the computer learns, which can be tedious and limits the ability of computers to discover things by themselves. Unsupervised learning, or what we call reinforcement learning, is when the learner is not merely passively observing the world, or how humans do things, but interacts with the environment and gets feedback. Humans are good at this. Combining unsupervised deep learning and reinforcement learning is one of the things that I am working on.<sup>2</sup>\n  </p> \n  <p>So, here we see how Yoshua Bengio  explains that <i>building of meaning, symbolic representation as the key impediment</i>. To get around this, representations are <i>factorialized</i>, which is a clean way of saying multiple levels/dimensions of classification trees:</p>\n  <p class="quote">For more than a decade, my research has focused on the notion of learning better representations, which is the heart of deep learning, in particular, representations that have a property called disentangled. Disentangled separates the different concepts and different explanations - we call them factors - that explain the data, that explain what the agent sees around it, and that explain how the agent patrols the world. Disentangled captures some of the causality that explains what we are seeing and what the computer is seeing.<sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  I think it\'s exciting subject matter, and perhaps many would be less apprehensive if they thought of A.I. as achieving the behavior and  <i>predictable mind of pets</i>.

Two months ago, my <a href="#18-02-23">Feb. 23rd blogpost</a> and again on <a href="#18-03-08">March 8th</a> I mentioned 1.4 million new tech jobs, 20% growth year-over-year. And so, yours truly has decided to enter into this market after a post-graduate period of contracting and free-lance work. Let\'s face it, there\'s no substitute for the stability and the fixed schedule, plus the coffee-machine conversations are never short of endearing! </p>\n\n\n  <p>So far on day 2 (Friday, the 21st was my ceremonial first day of "putting myself out there"). I\'ve thought to start slow, while I gauge the territory, but Indeed and Linkdin are always safe bets to begin with. All in all, my general take is that this new job front, with hundreds of thousands of jobs month-over-month is for everyone. Most positions offer 9-12 weeeks training -- who ever said changing careers had to be shouldered on our own? HR is there! </p>\n  <p>As I am a night-blogger, therefore my new position--where and whichever it will be, won\'t interfere with my blogging--after all, I have truly enjoyed watching my readership grow, month-by-month ... so, thank you, dear tech readers. As such, perhaps along the way I can lend a view from the job-front, and any new trends I observe.</p>\n  <p>Examples aren\'t hard to find. I\'ve noticed that since the last time I\'ve checked out the job market, the pre-assessment tests are a bit more cognitive than previous years, which is good for strong test-takers--especially those that love to calculate the "arrival times of two separate trains leaving the same station at two different rates of speed ....". 50 questions in 15 minutes makes for a nice adrenaline rush--on par with a short run!  </p>';

So where does the balance lie? Again we must turn to Steve Jobs on the "intersection of the humanities and science,": </p>\n  <p class="quote">There are a lot of people innovating, and that\'s not the main distinction of my career. The reason Apple resonates with people is that there\'s a deep current of humanity in our innovation. I think great artists and great engineers are simi.ar in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicans on the side. In the seventies computers became a way for people to express their creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great art science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a sculptor." <sup>1</sup><br />--Steve Jobs\n  <p class="continue">I could not imagine a computing world were it not for the personalization that Apple introduced to the world, to us all. After all, I recall I was first transfixed in 1984, there I was a seven-year-old staring into the bright green letters   of my   Apple IIe ... </p>\n  <p>So, in this era of the algorithmic wild-west and impending regulations on data privacy, inter-app permissions, coupled with data breaches every week, how might regulations avoid stifling innovation? Steve Jobs didn\'t have rules as much as Mark Zuckerberg didn\'t have any rules. So, it\'s a relief that Zuckerberg, with intimate knowledge of innovation, can set his teams to work with Congress going forward, especially as Facebook conforms to the E.U.\'s <i>General Data Privacy Regulations (GDPR) implementation this May.</i> I for one hope that freedom for creative innovation will stay alive, even in the face of   growing bureaucracy in the web.   \n  <p class="cite">1. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cf_2PBPP-rEC&printsec=frontcover" target="blank">Isaacson, Walter.

  var blogpost13 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">Bitcoin\'s rise to prominence, the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto\'s identity--i.e., author of <a href="dist/docs/bitcoinWhitePaper.pdf" target="_blank"> the original Bitcoin White Paper</a>, and the platform\'s reliability (outside of value fluctuations) all add to the mystique of the crypto-currency.  Yet,     new advances and types, i.e. "groupings" of blockchain technology are not necessarily "replacing" their predecessors, but rather filling different blockchain needs; Needs that include speed of transactions, truly public distributed ledgers, safety from forking and DDOS attacks.  Since 2008,   groups of competing platforms follow a timeline, but should not be thought of as a cyclical evolution but rather growing tree branches that form "groups".  Bitcoin, Litecoin are first generation, while Ethereum and Ripple are 2nd generation with crypto-contract capability, and finally Iota and Swirlds\' Hedera Hashgraph represent   3rd generation <i>directed-acyclic-graphs (DAG), whose transaction speed actually  increases</i> with number of nodes.\n  </p>\n  <p>Each of these groupings shouldn\'t be seen as making the previous design obselete: They   serve different purposes. Bitcoin can never serve micro-transactions and the micro-economy because it can only handle 6 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum can handle 12 or so. However, micro-transaction industries require TPS in the hundreds of thousands! Only the 3rd gen  crypto-currency architecture   achieves TPS <i>ad infinitum</i> because it\'s scalability increases with size. The catch? DAG\'s are necessarily private entities, rather than the original two generations that are by nature public, yet can be privatized. 3rd generation DAGs are the opposite: They are by default private, and cannot truly be distributed without management. Further, <i>Swirlds Hashgraph has patented their source code, which contradicts many principles of blockchain technology</i>, beginning with core tenets  of the original crypto-currency white paper, published in October 2008. For history\n  \'s sake, here\'s a quick view of the Bitcoin paper\'s abstract:</p>\n  <p class="quote"><strong>Abstract.</strong> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled byi nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they\'ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.<sup>1</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>Irrespective of crypto-currency or crypto-contract, there seems to be a different kind of jump from 2nd generation to 3rd generation blockchain, rather than a progression. Research needed to fork into a different direction is because of the need for instantaneous, ordered transactions, which can never be provided by a blockchain design which "syncs" every 5 to 10 minutes. </p>\n  <p> So, what is this 3rd generation design? Instead of a singular block encapsulated in linked cryptographic, historical ledger blocks, hashgraph uses a "tangle" of one-way (directed-acyclic) network connections. This means that speed increases with the number of nodes, overcoming the Bitcoin micro-transaction problem. <i>In sum, near-instantaneous updates for financial, betting, gaming and social-media data needs are solved by the  third-generation DAG</i>, while longer-term and truly distributed blockchain needs will always be the terrain of first and second generation blockchain technology. So, given that Swirlds\' Hedera Hashgraph will be unveiling their platform next month,   blockchain critics and enthusiasts can and should read between the lines, er, I mean-- read  between the nodes ...</p><br />\n  <p class="cite">0.

  var blogpost9 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">For all the clamor about Bitcoin\'s carbon footprint, who doesn\'t love the sound of money?  And, for all the pitfalls of Iota and the ever-evolving Ethereum (and ever-present threat of forking), Bitcoin stands true among the crypto-currency platforms. Keeping it Simple,   the very limited, non-crypto-contract may just be Bitcoin\'s virtue. In a rocky world, <i>a plain, no-frills crypto-currency with stability</i> is incomparable to crypto-contract powers, that are not fully stable, like Ethereum and Iota.  </p>\n  <p>So, it\'s living the dream, but must it be so cost-intensive? Maybe, Maybe not, but where does the future lie for all that hardware? Where does the browser fit into this? First, what\'s going on under the hood: Note this article is older, but accurate in explanation--except for references to Bitcoin\'s value! </p>  \n  \n  <p class="quote">New bitcoins are created roughly every 10 minutes in batches of 25 coins, with each coin worth around $730 at current rates. [A typical home-] computer ... is racing thousands of others to unlock and claim the next batch.</p>\n  <p class="quote">\n  Let\u2019s start with what it\u2019s not doing.  \n  Your computer is not blasting through the cavernous depths of the internet in search of digital ore that can be fashioned into bitcoin bullion. There is no ore, and bitcoin mining doesn\u2019t involve extracting or smelting anything. It\u2019s called mining only because the people who do it are the ones who get new bitcoins, and because bitcoin is a finite resource liberated in small amounts over time, like gold, or anything else that is mined. (The size of each batch of coins drops by half roughly every four years, and around 2140, it will be cut to zero, capping the total number of bitcoins in circulation at 21 million.) But the analogy ends there.\n  </p><p class="quote">\n  What bitcoin miners actually do could be better described as competitive bookkeeping. Miners build and maintain a gigantic public ledger containing a record of every bitcoin transaction in history. Every time somebody wants to send bitcoins to somebody else, the transfer has to be validated by miners: They check the ledger to make sure the sender isn\u2019t transferring money she doesn\u2019t have. If the transfer checks out, miners add it to the ledger. Finally, to protect that ledger from getting hacked, miners seal it behind layers and layers of computational work\u2014too much for a would-be fraudster to possibly complete.<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>So all of this hard work <i>can be distributed</i> across browsers, which improves its energy-expensive plight. I wouldn\'t recommend running the demo in the article link below as it may overheat your device--it had my fan running double-time. But the internals are using JavaScript code for the math. Here\'s a look under the hood, and it\'s nice to see the role of <i>JavaScript graphics library, called D3JS, (Data Driven Documents)</i> playing a central role. So, below you see the browser accepting the SHA256 Hash along with the Bitcoin Owner\'s Address, and the JavaScript in the browser passes off calculations to the C++ running the JavaScript V8 engine on your computer. </p>\n  <img src="./dist/img/miningBlockchainD3.PNG" class="zoom" width="450px" />\n  <p>And so, what does it mean to mine Bitcoins across browsers in a distributed fashion? It is similar to the same concept as Ethereum\'s direction (or at least idealized by its architect, Vitalik Buterin), in running the Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain across all the browsers that download its GETH software. Nonetheless, here\'s a succinct explanation of the browser\'s role,again from Quartz: </p>\n  <p class="quote">Mining\u2019s ultimate purpose is to prevent people from double-spending bitcoins. But it also solves another problem. It distributes new bitcoins in a relatively fair way\u2014only those people who dedicate some effort to making bitcoin work get to enjoy the coins as they are created.\n  But because mining is a competitive enterprise, miners have come up with ways to gain an edge. One obvious way is by pooling resources.<br /><br />\n  \n  \n  Your machine, right now, is actually working as part of a bitcoin mining collective that shares out the computational load. Your computer is not trying to solve the block, at least not immediately. It is chipping away at a cryptographic problem, using the input at the top of the screen and combining it with a nonce [run-time, generated random number calculated only once, then discarded], then taking the hash to try to find a solution. Solving that problem is a lot easier than solving the block itself, but doing so gets the pool closer to finding a winning nonce for the block. And the pool pays its members in bitcoins for every one of these easier problems they solve.</p>\n  <p>In practice, distributed mining pays off quite well   for the owners of that address. My blogposts on <a href="# <a href="#18-02-28">February 26th  </a> and <a href="#18-02-28">Feb. 28th about blockchain sustainability</a> paint a less rosy picture of tying the currency value to the cost of energy, but multiple solutions and fixes exist to distribute the energy load to laptops on clean renewables, the mining cooperative way ... after all, who ever said money had to be so expensive? </a> \n  <p class="cite">1.<a href="https://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-page-you-are-mining-bitcoins/" target="_blank">https://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-page-you-are-mining-bitcoins/\n  </a> (The article link is harmless, but wouldn\'t recommend running it if low on batteries--it doubled the fan speed)</p>  ';

Here\'s more from the esteemed Abbott: </p> \n\n<p class="quote">\u201CWe have ended up believing that social reality is determined in the main by certain general forces, and that these generalities are then specified by combinations of forces, and further limited by various aspects of \u201Cindividuality,\u201D which in this sense is best understood as idiosyncratic higher order interaction.\u201D<sup>1</sup> </p>\n<p>And so, while academic research focuses on the "general forces" to better understand how groups work together, the <strong>bad thing that Zuckerberg did</strong> is not following in the same spirit of generality.<sup>2</sup> They chose to collect and disseminate our "likes" as much as our locations, and ... wait for the ominous music ... the <i><strong>non-FB connected mobile contacts of the Facebook clients\' personal cell-phones</strong></i>--flipping through someone\'s personal desk drawer is definitely pushing the rules of privacy. I addressed this issue in my <a href="#18-03-20">March 20th blog post</a> on Facebook\'s ethics versus the long-standing data-handling ethics from Academia. Regarding tomorrow\'s revelations, let\'s remember to give the guy benefit of the doubt, even if they were handily swindled, while they were swindling us.<sup>3</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p class="cite">1. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0049124198027002002" target="_blank">Abbott, A. 1998. \u201C The Causal Devolution.\u201D Sociological Methods &amp; Research.\n\n</a></p>\n<p class="cite">2. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/facebook-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/facebook-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica.html\n</a></p>\n<p class="cite">3. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/did-cambridge-analytica-access-your-facebook-data/" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/story/did-cambridge-analytica-access-your-facebook-data/\n</a></p>';

However, implications change as the conversation turns to the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Chrome V-8 JavaScript Engine<sup>2</sup>--you know, the web-app on <i>steroids</i>! </p>\n  <p>So what kind of steroids you ask? Let us say that the power of the modern browser lies in the open-source JavaScript engine, first C++ variation <i>originally </i>introduced in 2008 by Google\'s Chromium project. Open-source<i>-who?</i> (close your eyes next paragraph for the jargon-wary!) </p>\n  <p class="quote">A JavaScript engine is a program or an interpreter which executes JavaScript code. A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard interpreter, or just-in-time compiler that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form.<sup>2</sup></p>\n  <p>In plain english, this means that the browser speaks directly to machine code, and this is a big deal. Happily \'roided, the browser now accomodates tasks that the "App" was invented for: <i>To direct service work</i>--image and data loading, caching, storage, offline data, icons, notifica       tions, etc. </p>\n  <p>Now, through a "Manifest" file provided to the device from the browser, all of those same tasks are accomplished through a series of handshakes, and voil&aacute;: the mobile device doesn\'t see the difference between a native app and, well ... a <i>progressive app!</i></p>\n  <p>They say History repeats itself. In our digital lifetime, we have seen <i>record sales</i> surpass digital downloads again (due to streaming); we have seen the originally-decentralized internet return, or at least begin the journey, back to decentralization! And now, we have the once-lowly browser return with a vengeance and strength to replace native apps, with encrypted security, instant loading, and <i>better</i> off-line caching!

Hedera Hashgraph represents a blockchain alternative that caters to time-sensitive transactions, and order fairness. Currently, one transaction with Bitcoin takes about 12 minutes to validate. Ethereum is only a couple minutes, but in a world of micro-transactions and micro-second transactions, speed counts.</p><p>Next, Hedera\'s technology uses a consensus algorithm, which depends on  node neighbors\' "voting" elections. This means that the design is impervious to "forking"--when a part of the blockchain splits and no long syncs with the main blockchain.  More importantly, Hedera\'s consensus design is   built on Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT), so is then impervious to threats of <i>Distributed Denial of Service (DDS) attacks. </i></p>\n<p>So, lightning speed for validating crypto-transactions. Guaranteed security from hard- or soft-forking of the blockchain, and DDS-like attacks. Fairness in transaction order. Come May 9th, we\'ll see just how Hedera\'s codebase and cryptocurrency will accomplish these benchmarks, and if so, Heraclitean river stops in time!

Although we could all debate the merits of "Lidar", i.e. laser-based vision, the primary concern, in my view, is Uber\'s obvious carelessness in rushing their self-driving tech.  Although six thousand (6,000 too many) pedestrians are killed in the U.S. annually, I\'d only hope AI wouldn\'t add to the problem.<sup>2</sup> The Arizona victim was walking her bicycle when struck, and I as bike-commuter can\'t help but take the affair personally. </p>\n  <p>This first human death is at least a <strong>big Wake-Up moment</strong> for the industry in its haste to roll out A.I. tech.  After all, Uber\'s questionable leadership morals<sup>2</sup> and being kicked out of San Francisco for running more than six red-lights raises eyebrows to begin with.<sup>3</sup> My problem with Uber is that the car\'s algorithm, with perfect Lidar vision, did not flinch or slow down for two seconds as it killed the victim. Humans flinch and humans swerve, because protecting fellow humans is in our DNA, not in A.I.\'s. So, while we now know Uber\'s software hasn\'t caught up with its A.I.-Lidar hardware--let\'s hope we see defensive driving and some <i>TLC</i> programmed into those A.I.

  var blogpost17 = '<p class="firstparagraph">\n  Universities, private or public institutions, serve as a beacon for\n  <strong>the Fearless Protection and Ethical Regulation</strong> of information and data. This is because data and data research\n  is innate to the university\'s Mission Statement, whereas business and governmental institutions are relatively new\n  to the game, and often at odds with the\n  <i>Academy</i>, and occasionally against each other. </p>\n  <p class="quote">Threats to student data privacy existed long before the internet. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover infiltrated Berkeley\n  student groups to counter communism in the 1960s. Around the same time, the CIA manipulated the National Student\n  Association for intelligence gathering in other anti-communism efforts. But the privacy issue is more acute now\n  that the amount of student data in cloud-based systems has grown exponentially and is more widely dispersed.\n  <sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p> The University\'s expertise over ethically regulated data collection and management, is better than government, business,\n  and even medical domains for two reasons. First, the institution\'s long history and ethical motives with data are\n  unique. The norms of data-handling have been codified through the University\'s Institutional Review Board based\n  on its\n  <strong>stated mission</strong>. In other words, Universities take data seriously\n  <i>for reasons other than corporate profit or governmental control</i>. An example of personal data precautions has\n  played out with Harvard\'s recent data tiffs leading to the Supreme Court, illustrated by a 2016 article: </p>\n  <p class="quote">Last week undergraduates at Harvard University raised concerns about the institution handing over their data to an\n  anti-affirmative action group as part of a lawsuit. Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing the university\n  for allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants, will have access to \u201Cacademic, extracurricular,\n  demographic and other information\u201D from all undergrads who applied to Harvard between the fall 2009 and spring 2015,\n  omitting names and Social Security numbers.\n  <sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>The second reason why Universities understand ethical implications for data is that data and more broadly data and\n  human information\n  <i>research</i> is the institutions\' second highest priority, along with teaching and service. For example, in response\n  to the unethical Public Health research in\n  <i>Tuskegee Syphilis experiements</i>, the University instution\n  <i>stepped in</i> to help design the 1978\n  <strong>Belmont Principles</strong>. Currently, the University Institutional Review Board incorporates this with the Nuremburg\n  Code (developed after WWII NAZI research), in handling data research.\n  </p>\n  <p>In recent days,\n  <i>private companies</i> claim expertise for regulating "Fake News", and you guessed it,\n  <strong>regulation of data privacy &amp; confidentiality.</strong><sup>3</sup> The ethical authority over data privacy norms are nowhere\n  else than the University campus, case in point Harvard...

  var blogpost11 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">March 13th, 2018 marks the day that certain types of blockchain technologies, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, face\n  an existential crisis: Today, a new distributed ledger technology has been announced, which departs from the traditional\n  "Proof-of-Work" (energy-intensive calculations) Blockchain technologies. This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint.\n  For example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore\'s 49.8!</p>\n  <p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to\n  <i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking:\n  Denial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot),\n  so the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle. </p>\n  <p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly,\n  this is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950\'s (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating\n  system. </p>\n  <p>\n  Next, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of "fairness" because blockchain transactions are\n  <i>\n  <strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i> Bitcoin transactions are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle,\n  which is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p>\n  <p>\n  Swirld\'s unveiled their consensus-based\n  <strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has now been announced to\n  deploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news!

  var blogpost10 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">\n  Throughout the centralized-tech period of the\n  <i>mobile-powered </i> Web 2.0, most Sharing transactions take place on a centralized platform that simply facilitates\n  the peer-to-peer transactions. However, the trust is based on some third-party authority. For instance, Uber serves\n  as the centralalized, third-party authority between both consumers (whether resource-obtaining or resource-providing)\n  must place their trust. Similarly, centralized authorities like Paypal, etc. enable peer-to-peer collaboration.\n  Yet, the notion of trust remains unsolved: Both parties must place their faith in the third party. By definition,\n  this problem that undermines the\n  <i>Sharing Economy</i> is resolved by Blockchain technologies, through cryptography. Now, Decentralized Apps (DAPPS)\n  provide a truer sharing platform for value transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p>In short, neither peer,\n  <strong>neither consumer needs to be trusted, because both parties share a mutual trust in their shared ledger</strong>\n  (think of a thick book with an indexed log of each and every transaction, with unchangeable entries etched by cryptography.\n  In this fashion the forms of Exchange Value include:\n  <br /> 1.

Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer\n  marketplaces,\n  <i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer\n  of resources. By either sense, the\n  <i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media,\n  internet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>\n  \n  <p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s\n  <i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods\n  and services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>\n  \n  <p>In\n  <i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how\n  the\n  <strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>.\n  <sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3) breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general\n  purpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power,\n  sources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>\n  \n  <p>The first condition: New forms of communication to\n  <i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second\n  condition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition:\n  New methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>\n  \n  <p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving\n  solar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated,\n  driverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new\n  technology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>\n  \n  <p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s\n  innovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in\n  the present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively\n  the New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, how can we change the way we\n  <i>think</i> and how we\n  <i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on\n  <strong>\n  <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i>\n  </strong>\n  <sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will\n  a New Paradigm Shift emerge. In this occasion however, we as a society may not have the luxury of decades to adapt\n  to New Technologies, as the carbon hangover from the previous Industrial Era imperils the safe arrival of the next!</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  \n  <p>1.\n  <a href="https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/" target="_blank">https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>2.\n  <a href="https://www.economist.com/node/21553017" target="_blank">https://www.economist.com/node/21553017</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>3.\n  <a href="https://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf"\n  target="_blank">3.

This means that every institution, whether private hospitals, non-profit charity\n  foundations, or government bureaus, will effectively restructure (optimize) their own organizational structure in\n  an increasingly\n  <i>data-driven</i> paradigm.

Likewise, the telescope\n  has allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage)\n  a universe of knowledge--about\n  <i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the\n  data to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the\n  <i>output</i> can be\n  <i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the\n  key challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>\n  \n  <p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables.

  var blogpost4 = '<p class="firstparagraph">Germs present a timely topic for today, given the especially virulent\n  <strong>Flu Virus strain</strong>. Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era\n  <sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any\n  medical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39;\n  surface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively,\n  and provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics\n  are\n  <i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating\n  strains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies\n  relied on a misleading methodology.</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations\n  in the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which\n  manufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while\n  it is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains.\n  <sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu\n  virus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu\n  <i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with\n  <i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses\n  that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that\n  are pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic\n  tree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system\n  exposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond\n  <sup>2</sup>.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular\n  period each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal\n  time-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further\n  away on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses.\n  <sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a\n  <i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also\n  provides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain\n  math can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort\n  of.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each\n  other, then conditional upon other factors. This being\n  <i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e\n  things: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any\n  <i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions\n  about a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our\n  sciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The\n  first of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of\n  which gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>\n  \n  <p>\n  The third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating\n  <i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better\n  handle on the multiple effects of\n  <sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large\n  Numbers\n  <sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new\n  <strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the\n  <i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician\n  out there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!\n  \n  </p>\n  <p>1.\n  <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail" target="_blank"> http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail </a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>2.\n  <a href="https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual" target="_blank"> https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual </a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>3.\n  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm" target="_blank"> https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm </a>\n  </p>\n  ';

So the\n<i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost\nof the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the\n<i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then\nperhaps the other edge looks preferred!\n</p>\n\n<p>1.\n<a href="\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\n" target="_blank"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\n<a href="\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\n" target="_blank"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption </a>\n</p>\n';

    <p class="firstparagraph">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin and other
  
  cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology (peer-to-peer global
  
  ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate, individual needs and uses.
  
  These blockchain &quot;network&quot; analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network changes, node
  
  changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly or not.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships) that
  
  include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain tech must face analytical
  
  challenges that arise from informal practices
  
  <sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role&#39;s protocol for
  
  the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan&#39;s (1977)
  
  <i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple
  
  <i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time, convenience,
  
  etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm human understanding
  
  <i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of a bank, a person,
  
  or a company&#39;s internal bot?</p> 
  
  <p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought the
  
  world the blockchain tool, <s>for which</s> the Hard Sciences can and must share and propogate it's technical expertise <i>and higher standard of metric truth</i><s style="color:purple" class="strike-purple"> not contribute everything, especially relating with</s> to the other sciences that are still lagging behind--namely The Discipline of Sociology</s> toward acclimating to the modern age's social priorities and needs. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the multi-dimensional layers of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks--probably 700 of the 1,000. And how many social scientists can understand the technological sciences? Probably 200 out of 1,000. This means that <i>a chunk of the scientific displines suffer from acute innumeracy</i>. So how do we bridge this massive knowledge gap between qualitative meaning in the smart-contract.</p>
  
  <p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved, integrated through multiple layers of &quot;middlemen&quot;, such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions, non-governmental, non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases the middlemen. Suddenly, one programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team of hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the life of
  the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years&#39; Sociology Network Analysts&#39;
  research and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and should not turn to the
  Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already at home, safe within the academic
  domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology
  can either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances, accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises.
  Or, the next ten years can follow Sociology&#39;s Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful
  future.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Examples aside, the <s>primacy</s> innumeracy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on
  
  review of the Sociologists&#39; specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships,
  
  within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships.
  
  <s>We</s> Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized by fixed patterns. This implies a higher level of competency to accurately judge a point-of-view without the ability to directly consult machine learning. <i>This is a Code or Be Coded moment in the sciences.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes that characterize societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large Number Statistical Theory
  
  become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900&#39;s Sociological French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach&#39;s
  
  work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society&#39;s Collective Memory.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic&#39;s &quot;irrational
  
  behaviors&quot; and Mathematical &quot;complexity models&quot; do not
  
  <i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate simultaneous
  
  node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups
  
  get jobs), and most importantly the
  
  <i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time and fixed.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Fine. So, why is Sociology&#39;s network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th and
  
  20th centuries&#39; network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era, while North
  
  American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960&#39;s [post-1968], U.S. in the 1990&#39;s[post-1999],
  
  in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of past sociology are inherently small-data and
  
  more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates &quot;human-ness&quot; into the billion rows and
  
  columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation
  
  for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of each relationship
  
  (link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is
  
  possible to isolate directional, conditional
  
  <i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation
  
  <sup >2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on social networks.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person
  
  <i>self-selects </i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group&#39;s
  
  behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group&#39;s behavior,
  
  by the group&#39;s influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder&#39;s SIENA software, achieves
  
  the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology. The network graph
  
  can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not
  
  as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes
  
  (social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount
  
  of missing data</p>
  
  
  
  <p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear, directed
  
  path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists are called upon,
  
  blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again the same bugs. Sadly, this
  
  semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain for their currency, contract,
  
  and other societal needs--in this case, the blind would indeed lead the blind.</p>

  var blogpost16 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed Order of\nCoders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from structural design.\nHence, in the early 2000&#39;s, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to abide by The scaffolding\nof HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we must throw out this antiquated division\nof labor within web coding.</p>\n\n<p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules and components\nMust hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled html, js, css, it is now requisite\nto divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and\n<i>\neach</i> of these component teams\n<strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module&#39;s required html, js, css.</p>\n\n<p>This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and\nall coding will necessarily begin to &#39;reinvent the wheel.&#39; This is because any module, any library you go\nto, will\n<i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate new\ncss from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual misery, almost\ninstantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>\n\n<p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher level of abstraction,\nleaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice in the modern world, and if\nad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity? If yesterday&#39;s craft was the\nhoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part\nby part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and\npastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module\ndefinition? That&#39;s absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules.</p>\n\n<p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an age that\neach year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic sugar and also fundamental\nstructure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us\nto a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the &quot;Separation of Concerns.&quot; We can allow ourselves\na break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must\n<i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create!</p>\n  ';
  var blogpost15 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">Facebook Scandals\n<sup>1</sup> of recent months have demoralized the leadership for a role of misinformation in the Tech Age, however I\ncharge Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s innocence\n<i>not</i> because all of us, as a society, were equally warned. Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created abnormal,\nnever-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were so efficient at multiplying\nand exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social\nlearning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own control.</p>\n\n<p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial\n<sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation were\nnot entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural changes from\nhigher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in their content and influence)\nbegin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes\ndominated by the relationships, e.g., the &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;shares&quot;, leading to a statistically natural\npropensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel\nto the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal\nand tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary\n<i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>\n\n<p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual &quot;interruptions&quot; that\npreviously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains:</p>\n\n<p class="quote">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication that the\ntimespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation Bias, misinformation\nand outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that are already hard to change.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,\n<i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network phenomonenon--ultimately\ndriven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry, conditional influences, and\nthe strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these factors, our social inclinations were\n<i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were!</p>\n\n<p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network phenomena\n-- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!</p>\n\n<p class="footnotes">1.

Sure, it&#39;s more\nof a &quot;metropolitan&quot; phenomenon; and sure, it&#39;s become an accepted global platform--along with myriad\nother crypto-currencies, but it&#39;s exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies\nare useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency&#39;s rise to\nfame with last year&#39;s increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its contributions,\nuses, fame are one-sidedly\n<i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article\n<sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of\n<i>actual</i> use at the &quot;cash-registers&quot; of society.</p>\n\n<p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological\n<i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Rogers&#39;\n<i>Diffusion of Innovations</i>\n<sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger&#39;s bell curve\nranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However, the blockchain\narticles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine usefulness for the\nevery-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>\n\n<p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is\n<i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific information--whether\nfinancial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order before I continue, since we can\nall relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most notably concerning Target store credit card\nhacks a couple years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions,\nthis person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction:\nthey prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that $27, $200,\nor $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their\n<i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and if the store&#39;s\ndatabases are hacked, then tough-luck!</p>\n\n<p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for each transaction,\nproviding the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient! Nobody thinks to walk around\nwith their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit\ncard system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions\nhave had to rely on the many layers of security, passwords, pins, mothers&#39; maiden names, etc. Then, based on\nthe mathematics behind prime numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright\nred target on it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And that, my\nfriends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency, instead\nthe crypto-\n<i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero&#39;s name\nis the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide pinpointed,\n<i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for the sake of\nrenting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don&#39;t need this. They need\nto know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire governmental database of information\nabout you!</p>\n\n<p>1.\n<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-big-in-investing-but-still-lousy-for-buying-a-sandwich/"\ntarget="_blank">https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-big-in-investing-but-still-lousy-for-buying-a-sandwich/</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\n<a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED065999" target="_blank">Rogers, E.

  var blogpost10 = '\n  \n<p class="firstparagraph">7 Ethereum-based technological features offer us a new world -- a decentralized new world, not dependent on the centralized\nservers and bandwidth of Instagram, Comcast, T-Mobile, Amazon, Google, etc. With that statement ends general consensus among blockchain\nexperts, pundits, and authors. However, if the current logistical obstacles provide controversy and competing algorithms\nover sustainability, security, and scalability, then they reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses\n(and potential effects) than they hide. In my February 15th\n<a href="#18-02-15">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects of the\ncrypto-contract horizon.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Prologue</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the\n<i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals? First, a\nlittle background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum blockchain helps distinguish\nitself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech, like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based\nblockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming features, e.g. &quot;looping&quot;, &quot;recursion&quot;,\nwith the full power of a\n<i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable problem.</p>\n\n<p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the accounting\nsystem of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction, An Ethereum\nblockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,\n<i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks to calculate\ninto a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Ethereum&#39;s Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum\nblockchain is actually a &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, like a a big networked &quot;home computer&quot;. The native\nlanguage of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an\n<i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home computer,\nthen directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman&#39;s terms, the manner that modern-day app,\nfor example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one programming system\nto interact with another, such as Instragram offers a &quot;sharing API&quot; that connects to hardware contacts,\nthus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook\naccount, via your T-Mobile phone&#39;s contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we\nlive in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system,\nwhich exchanges API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier.</p>\n\n<p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity\ndays; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise. The reason\nbeing that digital math uses binary &quot;on/off&quot; calculations, while quantum math implicates a tertiary,\n<i>qubit</i> &quot;simultaneous states&quot;. Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology,\nboth programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA&#39;s blockchain\ndesign utilizes a\n<i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one&#39;s transaction is entered into with a private-key, and the blockchain\nmoreso resembles a &quot;Tangle&quot; of a directed graph, which allows for computational &quot;states&quot;. IOTA\nrecently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent vulnerability.\nIn truth, this was a case of user-error because users were\n<i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer could\ncrack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough now to cause\ndamage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Social\nuseablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun to emerge, at least in form,\nwith little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd generation Patrician directed graph blockchain.\nThe underlying principle of the blockchain&#39;s micro-economic utiliity through crypto-\n<i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions for Supply\n&amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of the Hard Sciences of\nMathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.</p>\n  ';
  var blogpost9 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">The guiding light through the centuries of scientific paradigms, in the Kuhnian sense\n<sup >1</sup>, have derived from deductive ideas from above - whether priestly or royal decree. Then, the primacy of the\n<i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then other Paradigm\nShifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment authors of 17th, 18th\ncentury. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era&#39;s emerging paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority\nand responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment.\n<i>Historical Materialism</i>\n<sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from governmental,\nfinancial sources, but rather the\n<i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the revolutionary\nshift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable data-sharing. Cryptography\nhas in a sense become a\n<i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong>\n<br /> Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical proof, rather\nthan exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern period also has held this\ndecentralized, individual authority as the\n<i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions of humankind,\nnot idealogies. In fact, it was the\n<i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western Philosophy,\nby laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical &quot;ground&quot; upward. This &quot;upside-down\ntree&quot; defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of\n<i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism, as argued\nin Sartre&#39;s\n<i>Search for a Method</i>.\n<sup>3</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations since Hegel.\nI&#39;m so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels. First, cryptography\nresemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern social rule (Some once thought\nnuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown. Secondly, I&#39;m still dumbfounded that\na Paradigm Shift\n<i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for a society that\nis provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon thousands of\nopen-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum Virtual Machine, whose\naims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for removing the &quot;middle-person&quot;\nfrom the day-to-day, micro-economic &quot;cost of living&quot;. This goes for for the exchanging of titles, legal\ndocuments, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing necessity in allocating\nincreasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of\n<i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms on the near\nhorizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on\n<i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient by means of\nblockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing, etc.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>III. Removing Double-Dipping from International Remittances </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<i>&quot;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&quot;\n</i>\n<br /> --Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, 1939</p>\n\n<p>Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute;\nla Western Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. The existing remittance system (not speaking\nto\n<i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian friend&#39;s\nCanadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national payments systems,\nthus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut. Like everything else--c&#39;est la vie. Or is it?\nThe beauty of Ethereum is that it &quot;talks&quot; well with others and across borders, while Bitcoin remains of\nlittle use for micro-transactions that involve semi-basic calculations.

The Swiss\nLeak held around 60,000 files that contained information about over 100,000 clients in 203 countries, which means\nthat the resulting graph database had more than 275,000 nodes with 400,000 relationships among them.</p>\n\n<p class="quote">By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections\nthan they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and regulators\nacross the globe.</p>\n\n<p>And you thought that plagiarism-detecting software was impressive for complexity! The beauty of this newly available\nsoftware (even Microsoft jumped on board in recent years) means that sociologists, economists can begin to make\nbetter headway in the way that our many interactions become more complex with more data. Remember, in the past ten\nminutes, more data information was just produced than most of human history! Thus, new and upcoming needs in domains\nlike content management &amp; access control, geo-routing (public transportation), gene sequencing, bio-informatics,\nand so on. So, as technology takes us forward, and we make our considerations, let&#39;s stick by the golden rules\nof parallel processing, scalability, and, now, graph-network mindedness for the new data structures, and schema,\nof the Era!</p>\n\n<p>1.\n<a href="https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/how-a-graph-database-unearthed-major-financial-improprieties/"\ntarget="_blank"> https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/how-a-graph-database-unearthed-major-financial-improprieties/ </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\n<a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/analyzing-panama-papers-neo4j/">By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections\nthan they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and regulators\nacross the globe. </a>\n<br /> Other major vendors in graph data structures based on Neo4j: OrientDB, ArangoDB, Titan, mongoDB, Complexible Stardog,\nand Franz AllegroGraph.</p>\n  ';

  var blogpost6 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">While I&#39;ve had blockchain-related topics on the mind lately, it seems I can&#39;t escape it as I broach new fields--blockchain\n  is everywhere! Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated speed of language and syntax formation,\n  and the curious phenomenon I&#39;d call, for lack of a better word or or my own reading, &quot;declarative-syntax-merging&quot;.\n  This involves the curious, and largely unknown, growth of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain\n  of web apps, data analysis, and even the bounds of\n  <i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won&#39;t submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say that, &quot;If\n  a certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed in JavaScript.&quot;</p>\n  \n  <p>Without getting into technicals, I&#39;ll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged with\n  French, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand years later,\n  we can see how English grammar inherited it&#39;s Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the core vocabulary;\n  Then, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;house&quot;\n  from &quot;melche&quot; or &quot;haus&quot;, then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from\n  French, e.g. &quot;lactose&quot; or &quot;mansion&quot; from &quot;lait&quot; or &quot;maison&quot;.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new language called\n  Solidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English&#39;s time. The usual FOMO logic propels coding language use,\n  for example FOMO induced Microsoft&#39;s flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt it years ago.\n  <sup >1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents, one non-legitimate.\n  It is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of C++. For the layperson, let&#39;s\n  just say Solidity resembles a &quot;Liger&quot;, in it is at it&#39;s core JavaScript, yet with increasing sophistication\n  based on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the powerful machine-code of C++ ever more. And it\n  is a beautiful, but curious phenomonenon.</p>\n  \n  <p>\n  <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/microsoft-adds-ethereum-language-solidity-visual-studio-1552171">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/microsoft-adds-ethereum-language-solidity-visual-studio-1552171</a>\n  </p>\n \n  ';

  var blogpost5 = '<p class="firstparagraph">1.4 million\n  <i>new</i> jobs by 2020; End over end, year after year, the computer programming industry continues to add another\n  20% more jobs each year, for the next five years. This is the only field that demand outstrips the supply--and increasingly\n  short supply. So much so, the US Department of Labor forecasts U.S. citizens will be able to fill 39% of those positions;\n  there are not enough Immigration visas (especially in the Trumpian era of isolationism) to make up the rest.</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  \n  <p>So, how is it that only 14% of females in the entire field of cybersecurity? Silicon Valley is, at its best, obscenely\n  one-sided. At Google, only 17% of the company&#39;s tech jobs are filled by women. Facebook women staff only 15%\n  of tech jobs, and Twitter? 10% female. The figures on women in computer science across the nation, across the entire\n  industry are not improving, but\n  <i>declining</i>?\n  <sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Of course, we&#39;ve heard these statistics from any given headline, and in the halls across the university landscape,\n  starting with Women in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Mathematics) programs.\n  <sup>3</sup> Yet, why, with so much money, so many programs, so many non-governmental, non-profit effort?</p>\n  \n  <p>I argue that tech\n  <i>climate </i> is directly to blame. Who then? Not a person, but principles are to blame. Culture--often defined as\n  shared beliefs, norms, language and behaviors--can hardly be changed, but it can be understood.\n  <br /> There is a book, called &quot;Program or be Programmed\n  <sup id="24-4">4</sup>\n  </p>\n  , by which the author explains social consequences of a dichotomized society--between those that manipulate the environment\n  around them, whether automating tasks at work, or simply fixing a simple software bug, by adding a comma. This literacy\n  of the Current Era is akin to the 26-letter alphabet of written sentences and paragraphs, and--not to be taken for\n  granted--is the exclusive form of communication, outside of a 100-foot perimeter, up until 150 years ago. Knowledge\n  is not power, the communication of knowledge is power.\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  \n  <p>I argue that today, the power is to program one application programming interface (API) to talk to another API. In\n  other words, the ability to directly communicate with software at the command-line is not now a requisite skill,\n  but promotions would not escape this necessity! So, now reverting back to the subject of women in tech, American\n  leadership is in deep peril without more female insight. I will finish by citing that Ares, the violent, untamed\n  Greek\n  <i>god of war</i>, cannot always drive the Capitalist engine; because She, Athena, the\n  <i>goddess of intelligence</i> represents true strategy!</p>\n  \n  <p>1.\n  <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html" target="_blank">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>2.\n  <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/women-in-tech-facts-figures-and-percentages" target="_blank">https://fairygodboss.com/articles/women-in-tech-facts-figures-and-percentages</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>3.\n  <a href="https://www.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/" target="_blank">https://www.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/</a>\n  </p>\n  ';

  var blogpost3 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">I must confess that on the very day that Our Daily Tech Blog gets an under-the-head make-over for security&#39;s\n  sake, I wrote the new formatting file right over today&#39;s post. Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously\n  as I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether I change my\n  ways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely, Sustainability, a.k.a.\n  Carbon Footprint.</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms that build\n  a record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a bitcoin for their efforts.\n  <sup >1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high electricity\n  bills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity is gobbled up by small\n  and large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations!\n  <sup >1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other &quot;Proof-of-Work&quot; designs require electricity because\n  the investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for mining drives\n  the system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, is the electricity consumption really\n  <i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis site\n  <sup\n  id="digiconomist">3</sup> estimates\n  <i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity&#39;s mining. (A visa credit card transaction\n  is 0.00651 kWh. The entire Ethereum global blockchain could be &quot;using as much as 4.2 Terawatt-hours (tWh),\n  or slightly more than the country of Cyprus\n  <sup  >1</sup>.&quot; So, electricity comparisons are telling, but how does this relate to its environment impact, sustainability\n  itself?</p>\n  \n  <p>Carbon Footprint, our energy consumption index, can be compared to another element of scarcity, which dictates fluctuations\n  in value: Gold. According to\n  <i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household&#39;s Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article does\n  the math for us very succinctly:</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just more energy-intensive, but also has\n  a bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon footprint for both.\n  For Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. For gold, we assume a carbon\n  footprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined\n  <sup >3</sup>.</p>\n  \n  <p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin&#39;s worth\n  of Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2). At the end of the day, the electricity costs--if not sustainable long-term--could\n  spell trouble. Hence, the three S&#39;s, mentioned last, sustainability is perhaps a larger issue than blockchain\n  Security and Scalability challenges. Again, this is a problem that the third largest cryptocurrency does not have:\n  <i>Ripple</i>, which does not bear a carbon footprint\n  <sup >4</sup>.</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  \n  <p>0.\n  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/bitcoin-ethereum-or-litecoin-which-cryptocurrency-is-best-for-you/" target="_blank">https://www.cnet.com/how-to/bitcoin-ethereum-or-litecoin-which-cryptocurrency-is-best-for-you/</a>\n  <br /> For those new to cryptocurrencies, this is a fairly succinct article to cryptocurrencies, and their underlying\n  structure.</p>\n  \n  <p>1.\n  <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3zn9a/ethereum-mining-transaction-electricity-consumption-bitcoin"\n  target="_blank">https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3zn9a/ethereum-mining-transaction-electricity-consumption-bitcoin</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>2.\n  <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-mining-really-use" target="_blank">http://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-mining-really-use</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>3.\n  <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-mining-more-polluting-than-gold-mining" target="_blank">https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-mining-more-polluting-than-gold-mining</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>4.\n  <a href="https://ripple.com/xrp/" target="_blank">https://ripple.com/xrp/</a>\n  </p>\n  ';

These two are\n<strong>&quot;Proof of Work&quot; currency algorithsms</strong>. This means that the &quot;Demand&quot; side of supply-and-demand,\nderives from\n<i>difficulty levels</i> of crypto-blocks to mine.
