If you swap graphite for silicon, far more lithium ions can be stored in the anode, which increases the energy capacity of the battery. But packing all these lithium ions into the electrode causes it to swell like a balloon; in some cases, it can grow up to four times larger.\n  // <br /><br />\n  // The swollen anode can pulverize the nanoengineered silicon particles and rupture the protective barrier between the anode and the battery’s electrolyte, which ferries the lithium ions between the electrodes. Over time, crud builds up at the boundary between the anode and electrolyte. This both blocks the efficient transfer of lithium ions and takes many of the ions out of service. It quickly kills any performance improvements the silicon anode provided.\n  // <br /><br />\n  // One way out of this problem is to sprinkle small amounts of silicon oxide—better known as sand—throughout a graphite anode. This is what Tesla currently does with its batteries. Silicon oxide comes pre-puffed, so it reduces the stress on the anode from swelling during charging. But it also limits the amount of lithium that can be stored in the anode. Juicing a battery this way isn’t enough to produce double-digit performance gains, but it’s better than nothing.\n  // <br /><br />\n  // Cary Hayner, cofounder and CTO of NanoGraf, thinks it’s possible to get the best of silicon and graphite without the loss of energy capacity from silicon oxide. At NanoGraf, he and his colleagues are boosting the energy of carbon-silicon batteries by embedding silicon particles in graphene, graphite’s Nobel Prize-winning cousin. Their design uses a graphene matrix to give silicon room to swell and to protect the anode from damaging reactions with the electrolyte. Hayner says a graphene-silicon anode can increase the amount of energy in a lithium-ion battery by up to 30 percent.<sup>1</sup>\n  //     </p>\n  //     `\n  //      var blogcite10 =    ` \n  //       <p>1. <a  target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/welcome-to-the-era-of-supercharged-lithium-silicon-batteries/\">https://www.wired.com/story/welcome-to-the-era-of-supercharged-lithium-silicon-batteries/</a>  </p>\n  //       <!-- <p>2. <a  target=\"_blank\" href=\"\"></a> </p>  -->  `;\n  //     var blogpost8 =     `<p>\n  //     </p>\n  //     <p class=\"quote\">\n  //     </p>\n  //     `\n  //      var blogcite8 =    ` \n  //       <p>1. <a  target=\"_blank\" href=\"\"></a>  </p>\n  // <p>2. <a  target=\"_blank\" href=\"</a> </p>    \n  //   `;\n  var blogpost7 = `<p>\n     Democratization of access to quantum software -- Cloud-backed hardware and open-software API's available to the public -- has been broadly expanded with Google Cloud Platform's March 6th White Paper, which outlines a package of (data analysis) simulation hardware, which \"combines Cirq, an open source quantum circuit library, and the <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum\" target=\"_blank\">TensorFlow</a> machine learning platform.\" In short, the complete package: \n    </p> \n    <p class=\"quote\">Google today announced the launch of TensorFlow Quantum, bringing together machine learning and quantum computing initiatives at the company.

This framework offers high-level abstractions for the design and training of both discriminative and generative quantum models under TensorFlow and supports high-performance quantum circuit simulators. We provide an overview of the software architecture and building blocks through several examples and review the theory of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. We illustrate TFQ functionalities via several basic applications including supervised learning for quantum classification, quantum control, and quantum approximate optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can apply TFQ to tackle advanced quantum learning tasks including meta-learning, Hamiltonian learning, and sampling thermal states.

Typically, encryption techniques make it easy to encode data but hugely difficult to decode it without the use of a special key.

CES 2019, this year’s iteration of the annual Consumer Electronics Show, just opened in Las Vegas, and as per usual, the gadgets unveiled so far reveal a unique perspective on the everyday lifestyle problems that consumers apparently want solved. The problems? Too much privacy in kitchens! And not enough things that can be solved by app!  <br />\n  <br />\n  As Rose Elveth wrote for Eater in 2015, “Engineers... operate on the premise that people don’t know what they need until it’s built for them... the result is an array of potential futures that are strangely both unaware of the culture from which they spring, and at the same time constrained by it. The kitchen of the future is a one-size-fits all, ahistorical, acultural room, one that serves no one well.” \n<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  `;\n  var blogcite162 = `\n  <p class=\"cite\">1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eater.com/2019/1/8/18173843/ces-2019-kitchen-tech-ge-samsung-whirlpool\">\n  https://www.eater.com/2019/1/8/18173843/ces-2019-kitchen-tech-ge-samsung-whirlpool</a></p>  \n  \n  `;\n  var blogpost1600 = ` \n  <p class=\"firstparagraph\">CES 2019 offered the range of IoT wizardry that even Philosophy has been virtualized into LED-embedded wood! \n  </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">What does it mean that one of my favorite demos at CES 2019 — the world’s foremost technology show — was a block of wood?

So, the label of a Silicon-Valley culture that espouses teamwork can't be blamed: It's the nature of Software Engineers to develop gargantuanly complex programmed products, that dissent and critical thinking have much less place than most jobs. This article is laughable, but may bear a hint of truth ... \n  </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">The episode speaks to an atmosphere at Facebook in which employees feel pressure to place the company above all else in their lives, fall in line with their manager’s orders and force cordiality with their colleagues so they can advance. Several former employees likened the culture to a “cult.”\n<br /><br />\nThis culture has contributed to the company’s well-publicized wave of scandals over the last two years, such as governments spreading misinformation to try to influence elections and the misuse of private user data, according to many people who worked there during this period.

The probe zipped by at upwards of 31,000 miles per hour, about the same speed it was going when it passed Pluto in 2015. But Pluto is 100 times the size of Ultima, which measures just 20 miles long. So New Horizons had days to capture photographs and spectrographic readings of the former planet, but for this smaller cosmic quarry, it only had a matter of minutes. New Horizons' visit was brief, but momentous: The mission's success makes Ultima Thule by far the most distant object ever to be imaged up close.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n <img src=\"dist/img/thule.jpg\" class=\"zoom\" />\n  `;\n  var blogcite16001 = `\n  <p class=\"cite\">1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-horizons-first-photos-ultima-thule\">https://www.wired.com/story/new-horizons-first-photos-ultima-thule</a></p>   \n  \n  `;\n  var blogpost160 = `<p class=\"quote\">Astronomers have revealed details of mysterious signals emanating from a distant galaxy, picked up by a telescope in Canada. \nThe precise nature and origin of the blasts of radio waves is unknown. \nAmong the 13 fast radio bursts, known as FRBs, was a very unusual repeating signal, coming from the same source about 1.5 billion light years away. \nSuch an event has only been reported once before, by a different telescope. \n\"Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there,\" said Ingrid Stairs, an astrophysicist from the University of British Columbia (UBC).\n \n<sup>1</sup></p>\n  <p class=\"firstparagraph\">\n  Morse code across the Galaxies - what a concept! \n  </p>\n  <img src=\"dist/img/gettyimages-831502910.jpg\" width=\"350\" class=\"zoom\" /><hr width=\"200\"/>\n\n  <span style=\"float:right;\">GETTY IMAGES</span>\n `;\n  var blogcite160 = `\n  <p class=\"cite\">1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46811618\">https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46811618</a></p>  \n  `;\n  var url = [{\n    id: '1790',\n    did: '02-08-19',\n    date: 'February 8, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'Musing Blockchain',\n    title: 'Sustainable Blockchain Tech, Part I:<br />The Cost of Proof-of-Work Models',\n    post: blogpost1790,\n    blogcite: blogcite1790\n  }, {\n    id: '1789',\n    did: '02-07-19',\n    date: 'February 7, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'Web Dev Affairs',\n    title: 'Oracle the Great, Part II<br />Is Oracle also Good?',\n    post: blogpost1789,\n    blogcite: blogcite1789\n  }, {\n    id: '1788',\n    did: '02-06-19',\n    date: 'February 6, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'Web Dev Affairs',\n    title: 'Oracle the Great, Part I<br />Is Oracle also Trustworthy?',\n    post: blogpost1788,\n    blogcite: blogcite1788\n  }, {\n    id: '1786',\n    did: '02-04-19',\n    date: 'February 4, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'Sociology Tomorrow!',\n    title: 'Due North: Time to Calibrate the Compass?',\n    post: blogpost1786,\n    blogcite: blogcite1786\n  }, {\n    id: '1785',\n    did: '02-02-19',\n    date: 'February 2-3, 2019<br />Weekend',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'Web Dev Affairs',\n    title: 'Four Score and Seven Years Ago ...',\n    post: blogpost1785,\n    blogcite: blogcite1785\n  }, {\n    id: '1784',\n    did: '02-01-19',\n    date: 'February 1, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'Web Dev Affairs',\n    title: 'Four Score and Seven Years From Now ...',\n    post: blogpost1784,\n    blogcite: blogcite1784\n  }, {\n    id: '178',\n    did: '01-31-19',\n    date: 'January 31, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'A.I.Now.',\n    title: 'Seeing Who Says, \\'Say Cheese!\\'',\n    post: blogpost178,\n    blogcite: blogcite178\n  }, {\n    id: '177',\n    did: '01-29-19',\n    date: 'January 29, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'Web Dev Affairs',\n    title: 'Construction on the Internet Super-Highway',\n    post: blogpost177,\n    blogcite: blogcite177\n  }, {\n    id: '176',\n    did: '01-28-19',\n    date: 'January 28, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'A.I.Now.',\n    title: 'Saving Tappy, the Extraordinary Phone-Tester Bot',\n    post: blogpost176,\n    blogcite: blogcite176\n  }, {\n    id: '175',\n    did: '01-26-19',\n    date: 'January 26-27, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'A.I.Now.',\n    title: 'Who Dis',\n    post: blogpost175,\n    blogcite: blogcite175\n  }, {\n    id: '174',\n    did: '01-25-19',\n    date: 'January 25, 2019',\n    author: 'by Thomas Maestas',\n    cat3: 'Web Dev Affairs',\n    title: 'Internet Phaenomen [Greek]: To Shine;

This deal is seen as an early step in these agencies digging into potential anticompetitive practices by all four companies.\r\n  consumer view-->\r\n  That could result in a flourishing of new services and features for consumers, giving them a lot more choices for e-commerce, social media and search. That change could also sow confusion, as sites that used to be part of the same company no longer work as seamlessly together.\r\n      June 11, 2019\r\n  Most cross-border payments are done through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, a Belgian organization started in 1973 that counts 11,000 financial institutions as members. But its legacy system has inefficiencies. Because few banks are connected directly to each other, a payment that originates in Kansas City and is bound for Nairobi might have to stop at banks in New York and London before reaching its final destination, with each bank extracting a fee. \r\n  https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/06/11/visa-targets-swift-with-new-blockchain-product-for-global-money-transfers/\r\n  Visa seems to do everything on a massive scale. Last year, it moved $11.2 trillion over its payment rails across more than 200 countries for purchases ranging from cups of coffee to cars. Now it’s eyeing an even bigger market: cross-border, business-to-business (B2B) transactions, where banks transfer money on behalf of corporate customers. Visa says it’s entering a $125 trillion market and using distributed ledger technology—software where transactions must be confirmed by multiple computers on a network to be considered final—to make these payments faster, cheaper and more transparent.\r\n  Phalen’s team created Visa B2B Connect using distributed ledger technology because it provides more transparency and traceability than a typical state-of-the-art database, he says. They used Hyperledger Fabric, the blockchain software developed in part by IBM and hosted by Linux, to build it, and it has taken two years to launch. Unlike cryptocurrency-based blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum, Visa’s product isn’t decentralized, since the payments giant has complete control over it. Visa made Forbes’ first-ever Blockhain 50 list earlier this year.\r\n  june 6\r\n  Unlike the original vision spelled out in the Nakamoto paper, these initiatives don’t use a proof-of-work system for verification, but are permissioned blockchains in which each participant is identified and known—and therefore accountable—to the others in the blockchain network. Essentially this verifies members before transactions take place, much as Global Entry and TSA Pre do at airline security checkpoints.\r\n  https://www.barrons.com/articles/blockchain-moves-beyond-the-walled-garden-stage-51559820635\r\n  IBM hath been busy ...\r\n  \"To understand what the future of blockchain could look like, it’s helpful to look at IBM ’s recent initiatives to build communities around peer-to-peer networks in financial services, identity and supply chain.\r\n  The company is also working with SecureKey to develop a digital identity system in Canada. The system is designed to allow consumers to develop digital identities that they can control. \r\n  Perhaps the greatest opportunity for blockchain technology is in helping to streamline supply chains. In fact, a 2013 study by the World Economic Forum found that reducing back-office friction in international trade could increase GDP by nearly 5%. IBM has two major efforts in this area. It partnered with Maersk to create TradeLens, which aims to digitize global shipping and created Food Trust that focuses on agricultural products.\"\r\n  June 4 - Near-Zero Latency Apps and Bots\r\n  And then there's the question of what type of 5G signals are available. Verizon, like AT&T, has focused on what's known as millimeter wave spectrum, which is fast but has a limited range and can have trouble with walls and even foliage. Carriers in Europe and Asia, along with Sprint and T-Mobile in the US, have been using sub-6GHz airwaves for slower but more reliable coverage.\r\n  https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-5g-lab-tunes-up-robots-and-medical-tech-heading-your-way/\r\n  The bigger goal, Palmer said, is to enable whole new experiences -- in education, for instance, transporting someone who's studying glaciers to an actual glacier via virtual reality or a holographic experience that's not possible today.\r\n  When the next generation matures eventually, a whole array of technologies will be able to blossom in ways that today's 4G networks don't allow -- cars communicating with each other and with sensors on a highway or city streets at speed, for instance. The internet of things becomes a lot more than just you checking in with your Nest thermostat or an August smart doorbell. Soldiers and first responders get better, faster situational awareness.\r\n  June 3 - The $6000 computadora\r\n  https://www.cnet.com/news/the-new-mac-pro-makes-its-debut-at-wwdc-2019-starts-at-5999-available-fall-2019-apple/\r\n  June 2 - Steer Clear of TapeWorms: Practice Good Hygiene\r\n  https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2019/05/30/a-reminder-to-update-your-systems-to-prevent-a-worm/\r\n  EternalBlue Timeline\r\n  Almost two months passed between the release of fixes for the EternalBlue vulnerability and when ransomware attacks began. Despite having nearly 60 days to patch their systems, many customers had not.\r\n  A significant number of these customers were infected by the ransomware.\r\n  /// Quantum::: mainstream\r\n  AUTHOR::: Yun-Hee Kim at yun-hee.kim@wsj.com\r\n  Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\r\n  Quantum computers won’t replace today’s traditional computers, but they will become mainstream within five years, a top executive in charge of emerging technologies at International Business Machines Corp. predicted.\r\n  Speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival Wednesday, Arvind Krishna, senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software, predicted that with quantum computing, batteries could last “a thousand times longer” and airplanes could become lighter.\r\n  “All of these use cases, I think, will get solved in a few years,” Mr. Krishna said. “Pharmaceuticals and drug discovery is a much harder problem.”\r\n  Quantum computers have the potential to sort through a vast number of possible solutions—more than the number of atoms in the universe—with the calculations being completed as fast as a fraction of a second.\r\n  Responding to criticism from researchers that the U.S. may be falling behind China and the European Union to invest in quantum computing, Mr. Krishna said the U.S. is currently slightly ahead but does need to invest more. China is constructing a $10 billion research center for quantum applications. The European Union announced in 2016 that it is creating a €1 billion effort on four areas of quantum technology including computing and communication.\r\n  Mr. Krishna, who also oversees the integration of IBM’s $33 billion acquisition of Red Hat Inc. said he expects the deal—IBM’s largest acquisition to date—to close around June. The company has received approval from the U.S. Department of Justice for the deal, and is now awaiting approval from the European Union.\r\n  Asked about restructuring after the acquisition is completed, Mr. Krishna said that it wouldn’t result in any job cuts at Red Hat.\r\n  “This is a value deal, not about cost synergy. They [Red Hat] run on multiple public clouds. It’s got to be preserved,” he said.\r\n  In the public cloud space, IBM trails rivals Amazon Inc. and Microsoft Corp. IBM ranked fifth in the world for public cloud-infrastructure service in 2017, according to data from Gartner Inc., behind Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba Group Holding Inc. and Google Inc.\r\n  But Mr. Krishna said the acquisition creates a big opportunity for IBM to expand in the so-called hybrid cloud space where customers run some software in their own data centers but also use cloud services.\r\n  “I’m not trying to catch up to Amazon and Microsoft,” he said. “They are going down the path of public cloud and we are going to be hybrid. There is so much investment that’s already happening and there is so much data that can’t sit on the public cloud. I believe there is space for all of us,” he said.\r\n  ///\r\n  The use of the trapped ion technology puts Honeywell in rare company, since the most visible companies pursuing quantum computing, including IBM, Google, Intel, and Rigetti, are basing their hardware on semiconductor technology.\r\n  June 1 - \r\n  https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/05/28/honeywell-one-step-closer-to-universal-quantum-computer/\r\n  In November, the company revealed it had started testing its first-generation qubit devices, followed in January by the claim that it had “demonstrated record-breaking high fidelity quantum operations” on its trapped-ion qubits. In March, it announced it had demonstrated “parallel operating zones” on the device, which it believes will provide faster execution and more flexible qubit connectivity.\r\n  Honeywell’s attraction to trapped ion technology mirrors that of IonQ, namely that these atomic level structures are totally uniform, naturally resistant to error-producing noise, and can be connected to one another in different configurations at runtime. While this technology doesn’t have the decades-long history and proven scalability of semiconductors, at this point, it offers the most interesting alternative for solid-state quantum computing.\r\n   */\n  var blogpost30 = `\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Substituting one material for another when in a pinch invites a panoply of complications when the quality of substitute materials vary by geographical and political borders ... <br />\n  <img src=\"dist/img/metal.jpg\"  width=\"400\"  class=\"zoom\" />\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Electronics manufacturers could be among the first to feel the full brunt of the trade war. The industry is perhaps uniquely global: Chips made in Oregon or Texas are shipped to a plant in Mexico to be attached to circuit boards made in China alongside capacitors made in Vietnam. It is not unheard-of for a product or its components to cross the Pacific three or even four times before showing up on retail shelves. \nBut nearly a year later, the trade war shows no sign of cooling off. So ControlTek, the electronics manufacturer that Mr. LaFrazia runs near Portland, is taking steps to protect itself, a strategic shift that has been repeated in boardrooms and executive suites around the world in recent weeks.\n<br /><br /> \n“We’re very much at the end of the whip getting thrown around,” Mr. LaFrazia said.\nIt was also unclear which products were subject to tariffs. Mr. LaFrazia, a 54-year-old Air Force veteran, recalled spending hours poring over an online list of tariff codes to figure out which applied to his parts. When he called the manufacturers, they often didn’t know where they fell in the government’s taxonomy of tradable goods. Even the government’s experts can get confused — ControlTek recently had a shipment of parts delayed for 12 days because customs officials thought they contained aluminum that was subject to tariffs.

In fact, there are only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined in total. Once miners have unlocked this many Bitcoins, the planet's supply will essentially be tapped out, unless Bitcoin's protocol is changed to allow for a larger supply.

Taproot is expected to be bundled together with an upgrade called Schnorr in a soft fork that developers have been looking into for some time, paving the way for privacy and scalability improvements to bitcoin.\n<br /><br />\nDevelopers have long been thinking about how to arrange this particular upgrade. There have been a number of proposed changes to bitcoin over the years and, as they are all related, it makes sense to implement them together. That includes Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), adding, improved bitcoin smart contracts, Schnorr signatures, which adds another way to sign bitcoin transactions, and Taproot, which adds even better privacy.<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n\n`;\n  var blogcite7 = ` \n<p>1.<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/new-bips-hint-at-upcoming-taproot-bitcoin-soft-fork\">https://www.coindesk.com/new-bips-hint-at-upcoming-taproot-bitcoin-soft-fork</a>\n</p> \n\n`;\n  var blogpost6 = ` \n  <p class=\"firstparagraph\">Bitcoin's bare simplicity--designed more than ten years ago, published October 31, 2008--has traditionally served as a strength of reliability in an uncharted industry field. Yet, in a complex and demanding Tech world, others took the spotlight--as the Bitcoin distributed ledger has been contrasted with Ethereum's complex scripting language, Solidity, which provides multi-variate <i>Smart Contracts</i> that are well-suited for Distributed Apps, <i>DAPPs</i> and generally for financial-clerical-legal documents. However, the once belittled simple, but reliable, distributed blockchain ledger leverages third-party smart contracting:\n  </p>\n \n<p class=\"quote\">\nEthereum has become the most popular blockchain for creating smart contracts. One of the major design goals of the Ethereum platform was to support smart contracts. From the start, this set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin, which was created first and foremost as a digital currency platform.\n<br /><br />\nAs the Bitcoin protocol has evolved, it has gained support for smart contracts. Smart contract functionality is not as programmable and extensible on Bitcoin as it is on Ethereum. However, using features added to Bitcoin through improvement proposals, certain smart contract functionality can be achieved through Bitcoin scripting.\n<br /><br />\nFor Particl, the most important smart contract feature in Bitcoin is the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode, which was introduced by Peter Todd as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 65. The opcode makes it possible to write scripts that prevent funds in a multi-signature wallet from being spent until a certain signature pattern is implemented or a certain amount of time passes.<sup>1</sup></p>\n`;\n  var blogcite6 = `  \n<p>1.<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/yes-bitcoin-can-do-smart-contracts-and-particl-demonstrates-how/\">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/yes-bitcoin-can-do-smart-contracts-and-particl-demonstrates-how/</a> \n</p>\n\n<p>White Paper<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf</a>\n</p>\n`;\n  var blogpost5 = ` \n  <p class=\"firstparagraph\"> \n  </p>\n    \n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  The self-proclaimed Satoshi, Craig Wright, is being sued by the Kleiman family on behalf of the now deceased Dave Kleiman and his estate. The lawsuit accuses Wright of fraud and theft of “over $11 billion worth of bitcoins and intellectual property from the estate of Dave Kleiman and W&K shortly after Dave’s 2013 death.” Last week the court ordered Wright to disclose bitcoin addresses that belonged to him before December 2013. The Florida Magistrate overseeing the lawsuit, Judge Bruce Reinhart, signed the order and gave Wright a few days to produce the list.\n  <br /><br />\n  Since then a list of addresses that were once filed in an obscure fashion was unsealed and Wright claims to have mined the first 70 bitcoin blocks starting from the Genesis block. After the redacted list was unsealed, the researchers at Wizsec decided to study the addresses and wrote a blog post about the recently disclosed file. Wizsec claims that Wright simply copied and pasted the addresses from the first 70 blocks and asserted the addresses belonged to him without any cryptographic proof.\n<br /><br />\nWizsec says the motion begs the belief that the self-proclaimed inventor acts as if he is “ignorant about the fundamentals of his invention.” “Perhaps Wright thinks that being a bitcoin miner means pointing at bitcoins and yelling ‘Mine,’” the researchers jokingly remarked. In the document, Wright’s filing continues to assert that he did not keep track of which Bitcoin blocks he mined and that he does not know any of the other Bitcoin public addresses. The motion further states that the self-styled Satoshi does not have a complete list of the public addresses that he owned as of any date.<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n`;\n  var blogcite5 = ` \n<p>1.<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/new-bips-hint-at-upcoming-taproot-bitcoin-soft-fork\">https://www.coindesk.com/new-bips-hint-at-upcoming-taproot-bitcoin-soft-fork\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.coindesk.com/new-bips-hint-at-upcoming-taproot-bitcoin-soft-fork</a>\n</p>\n \n`;\n  var blogpost4 = ` \n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Satoshi Nakamoto, the omni-present legend that introduced the final frontier for Trustless-based cryptocurrencies is worthy of the world's respect.

A 2018 study by Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT found that an automated system they developed diagnosed dense breast tissue (an indicator of breast cancer) in mammograms at the same level as an expert radiologist. Another algorithm developed by Google was found to “help detect metastatic breast cancers with significant accuracy and improve pathologist performance,” according to studies in the Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the American Journal of Surgical Pathology.\n  </p>\n  So, how can we best take advantage of these advances? Clear the brush! The meta-organization of healthcare technology and financing simply can't keep pace with the pure tech:\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  After taking a look, the pathologist might ship it to a specialist at another lab for a second opinion. Each time the slide is moved, it is packed up and shipped to a different address.

But although the proofs are new, they do not pass the test of exciting the mathematical mind. It’s the same for powerful algorithms, which can generate convincing short-form text, but are a long way from writing a novel.\n<br/><br /> \nBut in 2021 I think we will see – or at least be close to – an algorithm with the ability to write its first mathematical story. Storytelling through the written word is based on millions of years of human evolution, and it takes a human many years to reach the maturity to write a novel. But mathematics is a much younger evolutionary development. A person immersed in the mathematical world can reach maturity quite quickly, which is why one sees mathematical breakthroughs made by young minds.\n<br/><br />\nThis is why I think that it won’t take long for an AI to understand the quality of the proofs we love and celebrate, before it too will be writing proofs.

Relative Strength Index (RSI) - measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.<br />\n3. Bullish Hammer - candle that indicates the likely bottom of a trend. It is characterized by a long wick at the bottom with a short body on top. That shows that bears pushed the price down during the time frame, only to see significant buying pressure step in to close higher than the candle open. <br />\n4. Fibonacci retracement level - Method for determining support and resistance levels.
