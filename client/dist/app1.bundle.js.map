If you swap graphite for silicon, far more lithium ions can be stored in the anode, which increases the energy capacity of the battery. But packing all these lithium ions into the electrode causes it to swell like a balloon; in some cases, it can grow up to four times larger.\r\n// <br /><br />\r\n// The swollen anode can pulverize the nanoengineered silicon particles and rupture the protective barrier between the anode and the battery’s electrolyte, which ferries the lithium ions between the electrodes. Over time, crud builds up at the boundary between the anode and electrolyte. This both blocks the efficient transfer of lithium ions and takes many of the ions out of service. It quickly kills any performance improvements the silicon anode provided.\r\n// <br /><br />\r\n// One way out of this problem is to sprinkle small amounts of silicon oxide—better known as sand—throughout a graphite anode. This is what Tesla currently does with its batteries. Silicon oxide comes pre-puffed, so it reduces the stress on the anode from swelling during charging. But it also limits the amount of lithium that can be stored in the anode. Juicing a battery this way isn’t enough to produce double-digit performance gains, but it’s better than nothing.\r\n// <br /><br />\r\n// Cary Hayner, cofounder and CTO of NanoGraf, thinks it’s possible to get the best of silicon and graphite without the loss of energy capacity from silicon oxide. At NanoGraf, he and his colleagues are boosting the energy of carbon-silicon batteries by embedding silicon particles in graphene, graphite’s Nobel Prize-winning cousin.

This framework offers high-level abstractions for the design and training of both discriminative and generative quantum models under TensorFlow and supports high-performance quantum circuit simulators. We provide an overview of the software architecture and building blocks through several examples and review the theory of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. We illustrate TFQ functionalities via several basic applications including supervised learning for quantum classification, quantum control, and quantum approximate optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can apply TFQ to tackle advanced quantum learning tasks including meta-learning, Hamiltonian learning, and sampling thermal states. We hope this framework provides the necessary tools for the quantum computing and machine learning research communities to explore models of both natural and artificial quantum systems, and ultimately discover new quantum algorithms which could potentially yield a quantum advantage.\r\n    <sup>3</sup>\r\n</p> \r\n   `;\r\n    var blogcite7 =    `  \r\n    <p>1. <a  target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/09/google-launches-tensorflow-quantum-a-machine-learning-framework-for-training-quantum-models/\">https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/09/google-launches-tensorflow-quantum-a-machine-learning-framework-for-training-quantum-models/</a> \r\n</p>\r\n<p>2. <a  target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/announcing-tensorflow-quantum-open.html\">https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/announcing-tensorflow-quantum-open.html</a> </p>  \r\n<p>3. <a  target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02989\">March 6th, 2020 Google White Paper</a> \r\n</p>  \r\n\r\n  `;\r\n\r\n    var blogpost4 = `<p>\r\n    At a time when the national lines blur between multi-national corporations, and an interdependent global tech community, the 21st century space race is nonetheless well-defined -- however defined along the lines of sub-atomic inner-space. \r\n    </p>\r\n       <img src=\"dist/img/q-chandelier.jpg\" width=\"400\"  class=\"zoom\" />\r\n    <p class=\"quote\">\r\n    But just as the Soviet Union was the first to put both a satellite and a human being into orbit, before going on to lose the space race, China March be poised to outstrip any American achievements in a specific field of quantum technology — communication.<sup>1</sup>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the goals are less abstract than sending a traveler to space; they define how national secrets can be securely stored, accessed and communicated: </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"quote\">With Micius, Chinese researchers are attempting to use a different type of quantum technology to develop new forms of secure communications that would be unbreakable.

H&eacute;las! I cannot but acquiesce to them. After all, it was a dreary night, in the immediate aftermath(s) of the infamous <i>CloudStrike</i> bug that the misdirected accusations and misplaced assumptions abounded across the land. It was the voice of my ex-girlfriend, with whom I debated, that resoundedly defended Windows, because after all, CloudStrike (CS) <i>isn't a dependency</i>, a simple software. Blame it on the team, she said, blame it on the decision to install the software.. blame it on Delta. They should have chosen a better anti-virus like McAfee! To this notion I inserted my 2 cents that it was indeed a dependency of Windows. So it was both the fault of CS and how much more of Microsoft for allowing it. Further, the users of Windows servers were powerless to prevent the error. To resolve this enigmatic question, the reader and I must dive deep: </p>  <p > What really is the difference between the <span style=\"color:white;background-color:blue;\" >stomach-curling Blue Screen and Linux's black screen of death, or rarer yet, Mac's Pink Screen of demise? Nothing, it just so happens the former happens. And happens alot more frequently. </span> But why you ask? Because of the irascible and increasingly unscrupulous bi-modal architecture of Windows itself. </p> <p> My story cannot complete itself without touching upon these details --that the strict line between kernel-mode (i.e. external apps, users, etc are forbidden, being relegated to user-mode.) So what takes place in kernel mode? Well those delicate activities and configurations that only Windows will certify with ample testing, like the thread scheduler (bear with this tangent, dear reader), heap manager, and perhaps a graphical functionality, for example, to access driver, which would talk to the GPU across the PCI Bus. <br/> So, where does CloudStrike's <i><span style=\"color:green\">FALCON</span></i> fit into this picture? [Returning now to the point of whether or not this antimalware software Falcon is a dependency].</p> <p>Earlier antimalware not only looks at files, but also the behavior of the operating itself; hence the need access the kernel ... thus passing beyond the line of kernel mode -- a necessary evil you say? yes, a necessary risk. However, it used to be that modifcations of the this device driver (i.e. not hardware, just CloudStrike's Falcon software; any software alterations MUST therefore pass any tests, proffered by Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL), which at the end of such battery of tests, is <i>signed &amp; certified by Windows.</i>) Thus, the necessary evil-risk is indeed mitigated; and all remain happy, without any case of the blues. <br /> Sadly, though, times change and standards stoop ever lower -- because it is 2024, and the once-lofty WHQL no longer requires alterations to such drivers as Falcon to pass the battery of tests because of the advent of <i>now-programmable</i> \"dynamic definition files\" (which now re-program the behavior of the driver itself! ...thereby circumventing the once-strict line of defense that guarded the sacred Kernel Mode from harm.</p> <p>And so, my short tangent is completed, now that we know that this dangerous software can enter and exit kernel mode access at will -- The case STILL justifies Windows and CloudStrike because the User/Enterprise is still at fault for using this so-called non-dependency, correct? Wrong. Windows has allowed CloudStrike (in a bid to embed its software into the OS) to mark their driver as a \"Boot-Start Driver\"--id est, a driver for a device that <strong>must</strong> be installed to start the MS Windows Operating System.  Huh?!? Yep. Whereas most boot-start drivers are included in driver packages that are \"in-the-box\" with Windows, Windows automatically installs these boot-start drivers during first boot of the system. If a boot-start driver for a device is not included in a driver package that is \"in-the-box\" with Windows, a user can install an additional vendor-supplied driver package for the device; And in these instances, let's say on a Saturday afternoon when cleaning out the home computer, refreshing, and reinstalling software, these driver packages <i>should</i> be added to the image <u>offline</u> before the image is deployed to a system. Simple. And Safe. Right? <br /> Wrong. CrowdStrike did not want you booting Windows without their precious software! So instead you must reboot Windows in Safe Mode, to remove or uninstall this surreptitious piece of software.  And so, there you have it, in 1,000 words or less, this Spectre of the Past has been exposed, and the public can now act as Judge and Jury to lay all the blame on both Windows lax security policy and CloudStrike's ineptitude to not even test for null-pointer errors (the absolute simplest errors and simplest to test/protect against), while justifying and restoring innocence to the many clients, user or enterprise alike, who were left powerless to the impending doom that CloudStrike Falcon would shrowd the world--if only for a a weekend. So next time there is a Ghost in the Shell, we can learn to undermine and root out the perils that lay beneath!</p>`;\r\n    var blogcite7 = `  <p></p>  `;\r\n\r\n    var blogpost6 = `<p class=\"firstparagraph quote\">What is the true cost of A.I.

This 2021 Wired article's prescience on artificial intelligence is worth a read:  </p>     <p class=\"quote\">  More recently, techniques of machine learning have been used to gain an understanding from a database of successful proofs to generate more proofs. But although the proofs are new, they do not pass the test of exciting the mathematical mind. It’s the same for powerful algorithms, which can generate convincing short-form text, but are a long way from writing a novel. <br /> But in 2021 I think we will see – or at least be close to – an algorithm with the ability to write its first mathematical story. Storytelling through the written word is based on millions of years of human evolution, and it takes a human many years to reach the maturity to write a novel. But mathematics is a much younger evolutionary development. A person immersed in the mathematical world can reach maturity quite quickly, which is why one sees mathematical breakthroughs made by young minds. <br />This is why I think that it won’t take long for an AI to understand the quality of the proofs we love and celebrate, before it too will be writing proofs. Perhaps, given its internal architecture, these may be mathematical theorems about networks – a subject that deserves its place on the shelves of the mathematical libraries we humans have been filling for centuries.<sup>1</sup>  </p>  \r\n  `;\r\n\r\n    var blogcite1 = ` <p class=\"footnotes\">   1. <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/marcus-du-sautoy-maths-proofs\"   target=\"_blank\">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/marcus-du-sautoy-maths-proofs</a> <br />     </p>             `;\r\n\r\n    var blogpost0 = `<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Taxes ... simultaneously the ultimate bane and archenemy for the Greedy, yet also the easiest way to share; and sharing, whether compulsory or not, feels good.

Being honest about what you base your expectations on, and clearly conveying them to others in a timely manner, ensures your standards aren’t just high, but realistic and fair.<sup>1</sup>\r\n  </p>  `; \r\n  \r\n  var blogcite167 = `\r\n  <p class=\"cite\">1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/01/are-your-high-expectations-hurting-your-team\">https://hbr.org/2019/01/are-your-high-expectations-hurting-your-team\r\n </a></p>  \r\n  \r\n  `; \r\n  var blogpost166 = `<p class=\"quote\">\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p class=\"quote\">Americans love convenient recycling, but convenient recycling increasingly does not love us. Waste experts call the system of dumping all the recyclables into one bin “single-stream recycling.” It’s popular. But the cost-benefit math of it has changed. The benefit — more participation and thus more material put forward for recycling — may have been overtaken by the cost — unrecyclable recyclables. On average, about 25 percent of the stuff we try to recycle is too contaminated to go anywhere but the landfill, according to the National Waste and Recycling Association, a trade group. Just a decade ago, the contamination rate was closer to 7 percent, according to the association.<sup>1</sup>  \r\n  </p>  `; \r\n  \r\n  var blogcite166 = `\r\n  <p class=\"cite\">1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-era-of-easy-recycling-may-be-coming-to-an-end/\">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-era-of-easy-recycling-may-be-coming-to-an-end/\r\n</a></p>  \r\n  \r\n  `;  \r\n  var blogpost164 = `<p class=\"quote\">  \r\n  </p>\r\n  <p class=\"quote\"> “To continue delivering for our customers and to succeed in developing interplanetary spacecraft and a global space-based internet, SpaceX must become a leaner company,” the Hawthorne-based company said in a statement. “Either of these developments, even when attempted separately, have bankrupted other organizations.

Whether its <i>screen</i> time, selfie-addiction or mental dependance, it's never us as a society. I argue interactive tech saved a world of passive Movie & TV watching, passive reading ... leaving only the <i>professionals</i> to film, record music, publish and actively pursue leisure. Now, everybody with a telephone <i>can do</i> anything.</p>\r\n  <p>Technology has expanded average knowledge breadth <i>and</i> depth far more than it has undercut our potential. 25 years ago, specialized knowedge required a library. Besides the perseverence to get there. </p><p>If 18th century Berlin invented compulsory secondary schooling, thereby raising literacy from 10% to 70$ in one generation; Similarly, if 19th century Paris invented compulsory secondary schooling and revolutionalized learning as a national force, and John Hopkins the first <i>modern</i> university template for mass Higher-Ed; Then, by de Facto means, Silicon Valley has provided meta-knowledge that comprises a far more important knowledge: Tying unlimited knowledge to our most <i>social</i> device: el telefono. Thus, between the Wikipadia tile and the Twitter tile, one generation catapults over all previous generations--at least in terms of YouTube know-how and social awareness. Armies of bureaucrats and educators could not have achieved one-tenth!

CES 2019, this year’s iteration of the annual Consumer Electronics Show, just opened in Las Vegas, and as per usual, the gadgets unveiled so far reveal a unique perspective on the everyday lifestyle problems that consumers apparently want solved. The problems? Too much privacy in kitchens! And not enough things that can be solved by app!  <br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  As Rose Elveth wrote for Eater in 2015, “Engineers... operate on the premise that people don’t know what they need until it’s built for them... the result is an array of potential futures that are strangely both unaware of the culture from which they spring, and at the same time constrained by it. The kitchen of the future is a one-size-fits all, ahistorical, acultural room, one that serves no one well.” \r\n<sup>1</sup>\r\n  </p>\r\n  `; \r\n  \r\n  var blogcite162 = `\r\n  <p class=\"cite\">1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eater.com/2019/1/8/18173843/ces-2019-kitchen-tech-ge-samsung-whirlpool\">\r\n  https://www.eater.com/2019/1/8/18173843/ces-2019-kitchen-tech-ge-samsung-whirlpool</a></p>  \r\n  \r\n  `;\r\n\r\n  \r\n  var blogpost1600 =   ` \r\n  <p class=\"firstparagraph\">CES 2019 offered the range of IoT wizardry that even Philosophy has been virtualized into LED-embedded wood! \r\n  </p>\r\n  <p class=\"quote\">What does it mean that one of my favorite demos at CES 2019 — the world’s foremost technology show — was a block of wood?

So, the label of a Silicon-Valley culture that espouses teamwork can't be blamed: It's the nature of Software Engineers to develop gargantuanly complex programmed products, that dissent and critical thinking have much less place than most jobs. This article is laughable, but may bear a hint of truth ... \r\n  </p>\r\n  <p class=\"quote\">The episode speaks to an atmosphere at Facebook in which employees feel pressure to place the company above all else in their lives, fall in line with their manager’s orders and force cordiality with their colleagues so they can advance. Several former employees likened the culture to a “cult.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis culture has contributed to the company’s well-publicized wave of scandals over the last two years, such as governments spreading misinformation to try to influence elections and the misuse of private user data, according to many people who worked there during this period.

The probe zipped by at upwards of 31,000 miles per hour, about the same speed it was going when it passed Pluto in 2015. But Pluto is 100 times the size of Ultima, which measures just 20 miles long. So New Horizons had days to capture photographs and spectrographic readings of the former planet, but for this smaller cosmic quarry, it only had a matter of minutes. New Horizons' visit was brief, but momentous: The mission's success makes Ultima Thule by far the most distant object ever to be imaged up close.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n <img

This deal is seen as an early step in these agencies digging into potential anticompetitive practices by all four companies.\r\nconsumer view-->\r\nThat could result in a flourishing of new services and features for consumers, giving them a lot more choices for e-commerce, social media and search. That change could also sow confusion, as sites that used to be part of the same company no longer work as seamlessly together.\r\n\r\n\r\n    June 11, 2019\r\n    Most cross-border payments are done through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, a Belgian organization started in 1973 that counts 11,000 financial institutions as members. But its legacy system has inefficiencies. Because few banks are connected directly to each other, a payment that originates in Kansas City and is bound for Nairobi might have to stop at banks in New York and London before reaching its final destination, with each bank extracting a fee. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/06/11/visa-targets-swift-with-new-blockchain-product-for-global-money-transfers/\r\nVisa seems to do everything on a massive scale. Last year, it moved $11.2 trillion over its payment rails across more than 200 countries for purchases ranging from cups of coffee to cars. Now it’s eyeing an even bigger market: cross-border, business-to-business (B2B) transactions, where banks transfer money on behalf of corporate customers. Visa says it’s entering a $125 trillion market and using distributed ledger technology—software where transactions must be confirmed by multiple computers on a network to be considered final—to make these payments faster, cheaper and more transparent.\r\n\r\nPhalen’s team created Visa B2B Connect using distributed ledger technology because it provides more transparency and traceability than a typical state-of-the-art database, he says. They used Hyperledger Fabric, the blockchain software developed in part by IBM and hosted by Linux, to build it, and it has taken two years to launch. Unlike cryptocurrency-based blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum, Visa’s product isn’t decentralized, since the payments giant has complete control over it. Visa made Forbes’ first-ever Blockhain 50 list earlier this year.\r\n\r\n\r\njune 6\r\nUnlike the original vision spelled out in the Nakamoto paper, these initiatives don’t use a proof-of-work system for verification, but are permissioned blockchains in which each participant is identified and known—and therefore accountable—to the others in the blockchain network. Essentially this verifies members before transactions take place, much as Global Entry and TSA Pre do at airline security checkpoints.\r\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/blockchain-moves-beyond-the-walled-garden-stage-51559820635\r\n IBM hath been busy ...\r\n \"To understand what the future of blockchain could look like, it’s helpful to look at IBM ’s recent initiatives to build communities around peer-to-peer networks in financial services, identity and supply chain.\r\n\r\n The company is also working with SecureKey to develop a digital identity system in Canada. The system is designed to allow consumers to develop digital identities that they can control. \r\n\r\n Perhaps the greatest opportunity for blockchain technology is in helping to streamline supply chains. In fact, a 2013 study by the World Economic Forum found that reducing back-office friction in international trade could increase GDP by nearly 5%. IBM has two major efforts in this area. It partnered with Maersk to create TradeLens, which aims to digitize global shipping and created Food Trust that focuses on agricultural products.\"\r\n\r\n June 4 - Near-Zero Latency Apps and Bots\r\n And then there's the question of what type of 5G signals are available. Verizon, like AT&T, has focused on what's known as millimeter wave spectrum, which is fast but has a limited range and can have trouble with walls and even foliage. Carriers in Europe and Asia, along with Sprint and T-Mobile in the US, have been using sub-6GHz airwaves for slower but more reliable coverage.\r\n https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-5g-lab-tunes-up-robots-and-medical-tech-heading-your-way/\r\nThe bigger goal, Palmer said, is to enable whole new experiences -- in education, for instance, transporting someone who's studying glaciers to an actual glacier via virtual reality or a holographic experience that's not possible today.\r\n\r\n When the next generation matures eventually, a whole array of technologies will be able to blossom in ways that today's 4G networks don't allow -- cars communicating with each other and with sensors on a highway or city streets at speed, for instance. The internet of things becomes a lot more than just you checking in with your Nest thermostat or an August smart doorbell.

All Rights Reserved.\r\n  Quantum computers won’t replace today’s traditional computers, but they will become mainstream within five years, a top executive in charge of emerging technologies at International Business Machines Corp. predicted.\r\n  Speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival Wednesday, Arvind Krishna, senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software, predicted that with quantum computing, batteries could last “a thousand times longer” and airplanes could become lighter.\r\n  “All of these use cases, I think, will get solved in a few years,” Mr. Krishna said. “Pharmaceuticals and drug discovery is a much harder problem.”\r\n  Quantum computers have the potential to sort through a vast number of possible solutions—more than the number of atoms in the universe—with the calculations being completed as fast as a fraction of a second.\r\n  Responding to criticism from researchers that the U.S. may be falling behind China and the European Union to invest in quantum computing, Mr. Krishna said the U.S. is currently slightly ahead but does need to invest more. China is constructing a $10 billion research center for quantum applications. The European Union announced in 2016 that it is creating a €1 billion effort on four areas of quantum technology including computing and communication.\r\n  Mr. Krishna, who also oversees the integration of IBM’s $33 billion acquisition of Red Hat Inc. said he expects the deal—IBM’s largest acquisition to date—to close around June. The company has received approval from the U.S. Department of Justice for the deal, and is now awaiting approval from the European Union.\r\n  Asked about restructuring after the acquisition is completed, Mr. Krishna said that it wouldn’t result in any job cuts at Red Hat.\r\n  “This is a value deal, not about cost synergy. They [Red Hat] run on multiple public clouds. It’s got to be preserved,” he said.\r\n  In the public cloud space, IBM trails rivals Amazon Inc. and Microsoft Corp. IBM ranked fifth in the world for public cloud-infrastructure service in 2017, according to data from Gartner Inc., behind Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba Group Holding Inc. and Google Inc.\r\n  But Mr. Krishna said the acquisition creates a big opportunity for IBM to expand in the so-called hybrid cloud space where customers run some software in their own data centers but also use cloud services.\r\n\r\n  “I’m not trying to catch up to Amazon and Microsoft,” he said. “They are going down the path of public cloud and we are going to be hybrid. There is so much investment that’s already happening and there is so much data that can’t sit on the public cloud.

China is constructing a $10 billion research center for quantum applications. The European Union announced in 2016 that it is creating a €1 billion effort on four areas of quantum technology including computing and communication.\r\n\r\nMr. Krishna, who also oversees the integration of IBM’s $33 billion acquisition of Red Hat Inc. said he expects the deal—IBM’s largest acquisition to date—to close around June. The company has received approval from the U.S. Department of Justice for the deal, and is now awaiting approval from the European Union.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAsked about restructuring after the acquisition is completed, Mr. Krishna said that it wouldn’t result in any job cuts at Red Hat.\r\n“This is a value deal, not about cost synergy. They [Red Hat] run on multiple public clouds. It’s got to be preserved,” he said.\r\nIn the public cloud space, IBM trails rivals Amazon Inc. and Microsoft Corp. IBM ranked fifth in the world for public cloud-infrastructure service in 2017, according to data from Gartner Inc., behind Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba Group Holding Inc. and Google Inc.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBut Mr. Krishna said the acquisition creates a big opportunity for IBM to expand in the so-called hybrid cloud space where customers run some software in their own data centers but also use cloud services.  “I’m not trying to catch up to Amazon and Microsoft,” he said. “They are going down the path of public cloud and we are going to be hybrid. There is so much investment that’s already happening and there is so much data that can’t sit on the public cloud.

As explained by founder of ethereum Vitalik Buterin in a recent interview at ethereum conference ETHCapetown, ethereum 2.0 has “two major flagship components.”\r\n    <br /><br />\r\n    “One is Casper, which is our proof-of-stake algorithm which replaces mining…with something that we consider to be much more efficient,” Buterin said at the time. “The second part is sharding which is this massive scalability improvement which happens because you don’t need every computer in the network to process every transaction in the network any more.\r\n    <br /><br />\r\n    Buterin added that with sharding, he anticipates a “1,000 factor increase in scalability” to the network. However, sharding will only come in the later two phases of ethereum 2.0 roll-out. The first phase – dubbed Phase Zero – strictly launches ethereum’s new proof-of-stake blockchain.\r\n    <sup>1.</sup>\r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>The second improvement accentuates Ethereum's contract-capable currency (unlike Bitcoin's lack of contractual functionality), which means to revolutionize not only how data is persisted but also distributed, and managed at the individualized crypto-level! Using a language called <i>Solidity</i>, derived from Java and JavaScript origins, this crypto-currency stands first in line for upsetting the existing systems of finance, manufacture, and enterprise data. An exemple use-case ...\r\n   \r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p class=\"quote\"> \r\n    In the United States, healthcare comes from a patchwork of private companies, which means the handling of patient data is even more fragmented. John Halamka, chief information officer at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, told MIT Technology Review last year that there are 26 different electronic medical records systems in his home city alone.\r\n    <br /><br />\r\n    In 2016, Halamka teamed up with a group of scientists at MIT to try to find a solution to the problem using blockchain. They published their white paper on the subject in August 2016, laying out their proposal for a system that would help all those disparate databases exchange data — a project they called MedRec.\r\n    <br /><br />\r\n    Andy Lippman, a senior research scientist at MIT, co-authored the paper with Halamka. The system they outlined was to use Ethereum software — which, unlike bitcoin, can integrate and execute smart contracts — to build a private blockchain, linking healthcare providers together and allowing them to share their data.\r\n    <sup>2.</sup>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>So, as usual, Ethereum wins the day for both daily applicability and now a more scalable <strong><i>and</i> conscientious</strong> crypto-currency Tech!\r\n\t`;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    var blogcite2 = ` \r\n      \r\n  <p class=\"cite\">1. \r\n  <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/code-for-ethereums-proof-of-stake-blockchain-to-be-finalized-next-month\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.coindesk.com/code-for-ethereums-proof-of-stake-blockchain-to-be-finalized-next-month</a>\r\n  \r\n  </p>\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  <p class=\"cite\">2.

Despite the quantum-directed molecular behavior of biological organisms, the classical exponentiation of machine-learning statistical algorithms still does work miracles:  \r\n  </p> \r\n  \r\n  <p class=\"quote\"> \r\n  Studies indicate that using algorithms to analyze digital slides delivers diagnoses as accurate as an expert pathologist—and in some instances, the algorithms are more accurate. A 2018 study by Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT found that an automated system they developed diagnosed dense breast tissue (an indicator of breast cancer) in mammograms at the same level as an expert radiologist. Another algorithm developed by Google was found to “help detect metastatic breast cancers with significant accuracy and improve pathologist performance,” according to studies in the Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the American Journal of Surgical Pathology.\r\n  </p>\r\n  So, how can we best take advantage of these advances? Clear the brush! The meta-organization of healthcare technology and financing simply can't keep pace with the pure tech:\r\n  <p class=\"quote\">\r\n  After taking a look, the pathologist might ship it to a specialist at another lab for a second opinion. Each time the slide is moved, it is packed up and shipped to a different address. All the while, you’re waiting days or even weeks to hear whether or not you have cancer.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n  For decades, there have been limited ways to share medical slides, with information management lagging behind even as medical science advanced. But in the past few years, a new industry of digital pathology has emerged that could finally offer a more efficient and large-scale way of distributing and analyzing these kinds of samples.\r\n  <sup>1</sup>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>So, the good news from <i>the doctors'</i> occasional nemesis, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, decided that after 8 years of trials and hearings, truly scalable and sufficiently large sample data can now be digitized - hence personalizing the law of large numbers from the whole to the individual patient.

Despite the author's praise for ADA, he concedes the infinitesimally small likelihood that Cardano developers will ever approach Ethereum network --</p> \r\n<p class=\"quote\">Lastly, despite getting up to 7th rank, Cardano (ADA) is not likely to catch up with Ethereum’s much larger dev pool and network effect.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>And so, beyond Ethereum 2's Proof-of-Stake transition on the near horizon, ethereum enjoys a burgeoning ecosystem of layer-2 sidechains, facilitated by the likes of those as Polygon (Matic) solutions. Even so, next to Polkadot ecosystem, only Cardano stands as a viable challenge, how ever miniscule it may be...</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\n*Ethereum holds (by far) the largest pool of developers, according to Electric Capital. As a number of open source dev ops tools are available to make remote work easier through collaboration, managing developers remains a serious cog in DeFi development. Yet Ethereum and its developer community have thus far been dominant in this sense.<br /><br />\r\n*In the last three years, Ethereum has widened its developer pool by 215%. Such a network effect would be exceedingly difficult to overcome.</i><sup>2</sup> \r\n</p></p>\r\n`\r\nvar blogcite1 = \r\n`\r\n \r\n<p class=\"footnotes\">1. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cardano-prepares-launch-alonzo-testnet-130000976.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKH0bKJvZsFbQBykBexupKV-HvvhwSDQjmlBmyM4Q69AaNPYvc4Tk8LSJIyBqekdp0PAPL7kz0hTgJFEwOB3jchU4gzkApL6bQay9JZ2z16ddSW5RsCYEp049RRj-L_zFhrhze_83BrLCQjxz_-oOvLEbc8l3X_T4KdO8-eQf6cz\"   target=\"_blank\">cardano-prepares-launch-alonzo-testnet</a>\r\n</p>   \r\n<p class=\"footnotes\">2. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/node/21184597\"   target=\"_blank\">Is the Bitcoin-Ethereum 'Flippening' a Likely Scenario?</a>\r\n</p>\r\n`; \r\n   \r\n  var url =  [\r\n    {\r\n      id:'21',\r\n      did:'21-10-21',\r\n      date:'October 21, 2021',\r\n      author:'by Thomas Maestas, MA',\r\n      cat3:'Web Dev Affairs',\r\n      title:'Shifting Technological Super-Structures, Part III: <br />M1 Chip: What, Technically, is the Advantage?',\r\n      post:blogpost21,\r\n     blogcite:blogcite21\r\n     },\r\n    {\r\n    id:'19',\r\n    did:'21-10-19',\r\n    date:'October 19, 2021',\r\n    author:'by Thomas Maestas, MA',\r\n    cat3:'Web Dev Affairs',\r\n    title:'Shifting Technological Super-Structures, Part III: <br />M1 Chip: What, Technically, is the Advantage?',\r\n    post:blogpost19,\r\n   blogcite:blogcite19\r\n   },\r\n    {\r\n    id:'18',\r\n    did:'21-10-18',\r\n    date:'October 18, 2021',\r\n    author:'by Thomas Maestas, MA',\r\n    cat3:'Web Dev Affairs',\r\n    title:'Shifting Technological Super-Structures, Part II: <br />M1 Chip: Apple\\'s Strike Across the Bow',\r\n    post:blogpost18,\r\n   blogcite:blogcite18\r\n   },\r\n    {\r\n      id:'17',\r\n      did:'21-10-17',\r\n      date:'October 17, 2021',\r\n      author:'by Thomas Maestas, MA',\r\n      cat3:'Sociology Tomorrow!',\r\n      title:'Shifting Technological Super-Structures, Part I: <br />PC v.
