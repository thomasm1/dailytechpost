Keeping it Simple,   the very limited, non-crypto-contract may just be Bitcoin's virtue. In a rocky world, <i>a plain, no-frills crypto-currency with stability</i> is incomparable to crypto-contract powers, that are not fully stable, like Ethereum and Iota.  </p>\n<p>So, it's living the dream, but must it be so cost-intensive? Maybe, Maybe not, but where does the future lie for all that hardware? Where does the browser fit into this? First, what's going on under the hood: Note this article is older, but accurate in explanation--except for references to Bitcoin's value! </p>  \n\n<p class=\"quote\">New bitcoins are created roughly every 10 minutes in batches of 25 coins, with each coin worth around $730 at current rates. [A typical home-] computer ... is racing thousands of others to unlock and claim the next batch.</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nLet’s start with what it’s not doing.  \nYour computer is not blasting through the cavernous depths of the internet in search of digital ore that can be fashioned into bitcoin bullion. There is no ore, and bitcoin mining doesn’t involve extracting or smelting anything. It’s called mining only because the people who do it are the ones who get new bitcoins, and because bitcoin is a finite resource liberated in small amounts over time, like gold, or anything else that is mined. (The size of each batch of coins drops by half roughly every four years, and around 2140, it will be cut to zero, capping the total number of bitcoins in circulation at 21 million.) But the analogy ends there.\n</p><p class=\"quote\">\nWhat bitcoin miners actually do could be better described as competitive bookkeeping. Miners build and maintain a gigantic public ledger containing a record of every bitcoin transaction in history. Every time somebody wants to send bitcoins to somebody else, the transfer has to be validated by miners: They check the ledger to make sure the sender isn’t transferring money she doesn’t have. If the transfer checks out, miners add it to the ledger. Finally, to protect that ledger from getting hacked, miners seal it behind layers and layers of computational work—too much for a would-be fraudster to possibly complete.<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>So all of this hard work <i>can be distributed</i> across browsers, which improves its energy-expensive plight. I wouldn't recommend running the demo in the article as it may overheat your device--it had my fan running double-time. But the internals are using JavaScript code for the math. Here's a look under the hood, and it's nice to see the role of <i>JavaScript graphics library, called D3JS, (Data Driven Documents)</i> playing a central role. So, below you see the browser accepting the SHA256 Hash along with the Bitcoin Owner's Address, and the JavaScript in the browser passes off calculations to the C++ running the JavaScript V8 engine on your computer. </p>\n<img src=\"./dist/img/miningBlockchainD3.PNG\" class=\"zoom\" style=\"overflow:hidden;width:180%;\" />\n<p>And so, what does it mean to mine Bitcoins across browsers in a distributed fashion? It is similar to the same concept as Ethereum's direction (or at least idealized by its architect, Vitalik Buterin), in running the Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain across all the browsers that download its GETH software. Nonetheless, here's a succinct explanation of the browser's role,again from Quartz: </p>\n<p class=\"quote\">Mining’s ultimate purpose is to prevent people from double-spending bitcoins. But it also solves another problem. It distributes new bitcoins in a relatively fair way—only those people who dedicate some effort to making bitcoin work get to enjoy the coins as they are created.\nBut because mining is a competitive enterprise, miners have come up with ways to gain an edge. One obvious way is by pooling resources.<br /><br />\n\n\nYour machine, right now, is actually working as part of a bitcoin mining collective that shares out the computational load. Your computer is not trying to solve the block, at least not immediately. It is chipping away at a cryptographic problem, using the input at the top of the screen and combining it with a nonce, then taking the hash to try to find a solution. Solving that problem is a lot easier than solving the block itself, but doing so gets the pool closer to finding a winning nonce for the block. And the pool pays its members in bitcoins for every one of these easier problems they solve.</p>\n<p>In practice, distributed mining pays off quite well if only for the owners of that address.

Countless vulnerabilities, not to mention different standards and languages across the app world. <i>Like all Tech problems,</i>scalability requires Tech problem-solving--</i>in this case implying artificial intelligence.  About A.I., Mark Zuckerberg remarks:</p>  \n\n  <p class=\"quote\"> There are some really nuanced questions, though, about how to regulate [data] which I think are extremely interesting intellectually. So the biggest one that I’ve been thinking about is this question of: To what extent should companies have a responsibility to use AI tools to kind of self-regulate content?<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>A.I. help <i>would</i> alleviate the largest scalability problem--in the billions of accounts that Facebook now faces. Yet, the idea of robots mulling over data just somehow doesn't sit right. However such musing goes, the soon-to-be-implemented industry standard in Europe is the <i>E.U. General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR)</i> casts a long shadow: Facebook will need to comply to that regulation for European F.B. consumers. </p>\n  <p>Set for May 14th implementation, the standard was frequently mentioned during the April 12 Congressional Hearings. Interestingly, the GDPR takes a <i>direct stand against the concept of algorithm use with data</i> (without express consent), which begs the A.I. question again. </p>\n\n  <p class=\"quote\">The European law gives individuals the right not to be subject to completely automated  decisions which significantly affect them. These decisions could include credit algorithms that use an individual’s data to decide whether a bank should grant him or her a loan.  \n\n      Privacy International said the clause on automated decisions could allow consumers to challenge Facebook practices like political advertising, which can be sent to users based on algorithms, because the ads are meant to sway users’ votes.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n  <p>I think the E.U. GDPR data policy model is intelligent - who would have thought to re-humanize our personal data   by taking it away from algorithms, without our permission. I like that, after all, who likes to be unknowingly judged?

The Path toward Sound Data Privacy Policy\n\n</h6> \n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Day two of Congressional hearings over Facebook's Data Privacy and Protections  were better articulated than the first day. Important dialogue surrounded primarily   two data privacy topics: First, financial transparency surrounding ads and political ads based on the <i>Honest Ads Act</i>, for which Zuckerberg pledged support<sup>1</sup>. \n\n</p>\n\n<p>Second, and   more far-reaching, discussion of the <i>Browser Act</i> also was raised by several House members. While responding to the Act's sponsor, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Zuckerberg expressed interest in working together. This bill is not well known, but aims to set prudent, consistent guidelines of privacy in the hands of the consumer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\"> [Blackburn's] new bill targets the full spectrum of the internet, including web giants like Amazon and Google. In Blackburn’s words, it moves the government “to a posture where we have one regulator, one set of rules [and] everybody knows who’s in charge,” she told Recode.<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<p>So, however the power struggle goes, a <i>shared technology lexicon</i> clarifies that shades of meaning make enormous difference, depending on \"what\" an entity is--whether a technology is a Platform as a Service  versus media outlet or strictly merchant-based. Hopefully, <i>Tech will lead the way</i> without ceding authority in the process: </p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\n  But the Tennessee lawmaker’s effort hasn’t won any allies among privacy-conscious consumer groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, which doubt Blackburn’s methods. And her bill has already prompted a whole new round of fierce lobbying by tech and telecom giants, which don’t see the need for any new regulation at all.\n\n  </p> \n\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\n“I think that, in concept, the idea that there should be stronger privacy standards for edge providers and internet service providers is right,” said Neema Singh Guliani, the legislative counsel at the ACLU.</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\nBut Blackburn, she added, should have gone about it differently. “The way to do it was not ... [through] gutting the FCC’s rules; the way to do it was actively working on a replacement.”<sup>3</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>The bill is similar to the European data privacy model, <i>E.U. General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)</i>, which serves as point of reference.<sup>2</sup> On May 14,   Europeans will   be implementing a pan-internet--edge and ISP--data protections, which include e-mail, Facebook and other apps, equally as for Comcast and Verizon, and industry-wide privacy defaults; Further, opt-in for privacy is more meaningful separate, and  not relegated to the main Terms and Conditions.<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<p>Policy regulation in other industries--exemplified by medical <i>HIPAA</i>, financial <i>Fair Credit   Reporting Act</i>--reveals the noticeable absence of similar policy in Tech. Tech's regulation is however necessarily far more complex, involving at minimum trade-offs between app-to-app data portability and new boundaries for different sources and forms of data. Clearly, the browser-based, high-security HTTPS Encryption I mentioned in my <a href=\"#18-04-06\">April 6 three-part series on Progressive Web Apps </a>will undoubtedly be used for quick, inexpensive data privacy compliance, <i>a real boon for JavaScript developers</i>--as if there wasn't enough work already!\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"cite\">2. <a href=\"https://www.eugdpr.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eugdpr.org\n\n</a></p>  \n\n\n\n        <p class=\"cite\">3. <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/5/24/15685870/new-republican-privacy-bill-tech-telecom-lobbying-fcc-congress\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.recode.net/2017/5/24/15685870/new-republican-privacy-bill-tech-telecom-lobbying-fcc-congress\n\n        </a></p>  \n\n    <p class=\"cite\">3. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/technology/a-tough-task-for-facebook-european-type-privacy-for-all.html?ribbon-ad-idx=2&rref=technology&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Technology&pgtype=article\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/technology/a-tough-task-for-facebook-european-type-privacy-for-all.html?ribbon-ad-idx=2&rref=technology&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Technology&pgtype=article\n\n    </a> </p>  \n\n<p class=\"cite\">4. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-zuckerberg/zuckerberg-resists-effort-by-u-s-senators-to-commit-him-to-regulation-idUSKBN1HH1CU\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-zuckerberg/zuckerberg-resists-effort-by-u-s-senators-to-commit-him-to-regulation-idUSKBN1HH1CU\n\n</a></p>  \n\n\n\n</div> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"18-04-10\" class=\"      avr 18-03 -24\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"> <button>Top</button> </a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4> \n\n<h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5> \n\n<p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p> \n\n<h6    class=\"  chapternumber\">April 10, 2018<br /> \n\n</h6> \n\n<h6    class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">When a Pickpocket is Pickpocketed:<br />  Part II:  \"Semantic Polymorphism\", i.e., Double Talk about  Data \n\n</h6> \n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Mark Zuckerberg daftly played word-tennis with   Senators in the first day of Congressional Hearings on Facebook Data Privacy issues. Although, in this case, <i>there were two, at times three, tennis balls at play!</i> What I mean is that \"Data\" and \"Personal Data\" vaccilated in meaning:  At times, Senators' questions referred to, 1.) personally identifiable data with intimate personal details, full name, location data (sensitive-data); 2.) Other times questions referred to <i>derivative data, i.e. data wrangled, refined, merged with different datasets</i> (composite-data); and,  3.) sometimes the questions meant the harmless, identity-encrypted \"ad-data\"(anonymized-data); but, usually, Zuckerberg responded to a question about one of these three meanings of \"personal data\", by responding with a non-abstract fourth: 4.) \"Senator, the data, the 'likes' and pictures you share with Facebook, they are your property,\" Zuckerberg would answer. Well, thank goodness! </p>\n\n<p> My blogpost talks about the shades of meaning: We all know the light-hearted awkwardness when a conversation splits into two separate threads because each party unknowingly follows differing meanings from the same word, or idea.  Austin Powers would have more fun with it, but the Sociologists typically call it  a <i>Semantic Predicament</i>.<sup>1</sup></p> \n\n<p>In fairness, Mark Zuckerberg volunteered as he himself was not subpoenaed, and therefore this preliminary, public discourse was critical for creating shared meaning and language about a complex topic. By volunteering to engage conversation with Senators, Zuckerberg interrupts the <i>game of telephone</i>; and, Senators engage with their constituents, and lo, America saves two years' of misunderstandings for clear data-protection action now. Bravo, Mark! Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the braver CEOs in American history--Now, he has earned his place right next to Andrew Carnegie--and very similar lives, too. And now, with defined boundaries, <i>Tech has a better roadmap</i> for ethical policy and sensible regulation. So let the data debates begin--but this time,with only one   ball at play! </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\"> \n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"cite\">1. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9558.2008.00324.x\" target=\"_blank\">Abend, G.

These three fields approach research differently. Psychometricians are less causally oriented, as their tool, \"factor analysis\"--<i>analyse factorielle</i>--reduces complex data to dimple, categorical forms in order to reconcile <i>quantitative data</i> with intuitive categories.<sup>1.</sup> And this research is great for expanding knowledge about society. But to what end? Who's to say, after all society is both the subject <i>and</i> object of this research. Social scientists are used to these mental gymnastics, yet are bound by a certain ethos of research: <strong>Anonymization, i.e. encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from datasets</strong>. This is the Social Scientists' <i>Oath</i>--a line of decency. </p>\n\n<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday at noon, the world will tune in to hear Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before the U.S. Congress, all to hear about Facebook &amp; company's line of decency. However indecent any revelations may be, I'm not that entirely threatened by the revelations. Maybe I won't admit I'm   prone to Social Media influence, because I chart my course. Here's more from the esteemed Abbott: </p> \n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">“We have ended up believing that social reality is determined in the main by certain general forces, and that these generalities are then specified by combinations of forces, and further limited by various aspects of “individuality,” which in this sense is best understood as idiosyncratic higher order interaction.”<sup>1</sup> </p>\n\n<p>And so, while academic research focuses on the \"general forces\" to better understand how groups work together, the <strong>bad thing that Zuckerberg did</strong> is not following in the same spirit of generality.<sup>2</sup> They chose to collect and disseminate our \"likes\" as much as our locations, and ... wait for the ominous music ... the <i><strong>non-FB connected mobile contacts of the Facebook clients' personal cell-phones</strong></i>--flipping through someone's personal desk drawer is definitely pushing the rules of privacy. I addressed this issue in my <a href=\"#18-03-20\">March 20th blog post</a> on Facebook's ethics versus the long-standing data-handling ethics from Academia. Regarding tomorrow's revelations, let's remember to give the guy benefit of the doubt, even if they were handily swindled, while they were swindling us.<sup>3</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"cite\">1. <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0049124198027002002\" target=\"_blank\">Abbott, A. 1998. “ The Causal Devolution.” Sociological Methods &amp; Research.\n\n\n\n</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"cite\">2. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/facebook-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/facebook-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica.html\n\n</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"cite\">3. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/did-cambridge-analytica-access-your-facebook-data/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wired.com/story/did-cambridge-analytica-access-your-facebook-data/\n\n</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div> \n\n\n\n<div id=\"18-04-07\" class=\"      avr 18-03 -24\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"> \n\n  <button>Top</button> </a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4> \n\n<h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5> \n\n<p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p> \n\n<h6    class=\"  chapternumber\">April 7-8, 2018<br />\n\nWeekend\n\n</h6> \n\n<h6    class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">\n\nOn the\tInevitable Demise of   Native Mobile Apps in favor of Progressive Web Apps<br />Part III: The Nuts &amp; Bolts of the App Replacement Process</h6>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Revolutions come and revolutions go, but the <i>2nd app revolution</i> is already underway, albeit quietly.<sup>1</sup> Most media sources refer to a \"Native App - Progressive Web App Debate\" with emphasis on what the native app can already do--<i>so if it's not broke, don't fix it</i>.

For the impatient, this delay is not tolerable, and even the patient have their urgent moments (or have better things to do).    So, whether we're Verizon, T-Mobile, or pre-pay phones like Sprint's Boost, our experiences are the same: 3-second delays abound--much to our impatience!  </p>\n\n<p >Instant Loading </p>\n\n<p >In contrast, many of our daily web-based tasks are instant, i.e. a second or less. I feel instant loading should be <i>a right</i>, not an occasional convenience. what does this potential mean? This means an app's service workers can load nearly immediately and reliably. This means  non-choppy  animations, smooth scrolling, no matter the network connection you're using, no matter the device!  </p>\n\n<p  >Device-Neutral User Interface</p>\n\n\n\n<p  >After a long-day's work using desktop and mobile apps, why should an evening transition to tablet or laptop change our experience?

First, I admit I have a terrible addiction to statistics, especially bio-statistics. And, Fitbit is my enabler.   However, my post-run tablet Fitbit app experience is different and more limited from the HTTPS-browser experience. App features, options, views, date-ranges vary between devices.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p  >Security </p>\n\n<p  >HTTPS-level <i>browser</i> security vs. iTunes &amp; Play Store native app security is akin to a vault door versus building door.

Hedera Hashgraph represents a blockchain alternative that caters to time-sensitive transactions, and order fairness. Currently, one transaction with Bitcoin takes about 12 minutes to validate. Ethereum is only a couple minutes, but in a world of micro-transactions and micro-second transactions, speed counts.</p><p>Next, Hedera's technology uses a consensus algorithm, which depends on  node neighbors' \"voting\" elections. This means that the design is impervious to \"forking\"--when a part of the blockchain splits and no long syncs with the main blockchain.  More importantly, Hedera's consensus design is   built on Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT), so is then impervious to threats of <i>Distributed Denial of Service (DDS) attacks. </i></p>\n\n<p>So, lightning speed for validating crypto-transactions. Guaranteed security from hard- or soft-forking of the blockchain, and DDS-like attacks. Fairness in transaction order. Come May 9th, we'll see just how Hedera's codebase and cryptocurrency will accomplish these benchmarks, and if so, Heraclitean river stops in time!

That being said, I have my own soul-searching to do: TECHNOLOGY AIDS AND ABETS ME AND MY ACTIONS, but it does not run my show> Only I take responsibility for my own actions: I allow technology into my life as a tool, and yet I   hold the power cord.

This precarious, difficult and most of all laborious job of designing our own solutions will take time: For this reason, Uber should be shamed even further for their short-cuts, and eventual errors of internal, organizational problems. <i>Uber's experiemental, tax-free \"Testing Sandbox\" cannot be the erstwhile safe neighborhoods of Surburban Phoenix, without proper caution.</i> </p>\t\t\n\n<p>Are Uber's corporate desires, market stronghold, and shareholders' delight more worthwhile than <i>an entire sensitive field of machine-learning research?</i> No. Uber must be warned to not steal corporate secrets from Waymo, then proceed to be 86'd from California, then brush aside with excuses the <i>killing of an innocent Arizona bicyclist</i>.</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWho can count the number of very feisty taxi-men and -women that are not fans of the infamously hasty culture of Uber.

Although we could all debate the merits of \"Lidar\", i.e. laser-based vision, the primary concern, in my view, is Uber's obvious carelessness in rushing their self-driving tech.  Although six thousand (6,000 too many) pedestrians are killed in the U.S. annually, I'd only hope AI wouldn't add to the problem.<sup>2</sup> The Arizona victim was walking her bicycle when struck, and I as bike-commuter can't help but take the affair personally. </p>\n\n<p>This first human death is at least a <strong>big Wake-Up moment</strong> for the industry in its haste to roll out A.I. tech.  After all, Uber's questionable leadership morals<sup>2</sup> and being kicked out of San Francisco for running more than six red-lights raises eyebrows to begin with.<sup>3</sup> My problem with Uber is that the car's algorithm, with perfect Lidar vision, did not flinch or slow down for two seconds as it killed the victim. Humans flinch and humans swerve, because protecting fellow humans is in our DNA, not in A.I.'s. So, while we now know Uber's software hasn't caught up with its A.I.-Lidar hardware--let's hope we see defensive driving and some <i>TLC</i> programmed into those A.I.

This is because data and data research\n\nis innate to the university's Mission Statement, whereas business and governmental institutions are relatively new\n\nto the game, and often at odds with the\n\n<i>Academy</i>, and occasionally against each other. </p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Threats to student data privacy existed long before the internet. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover infiltrated Berkeley\n\nstudent groups to counter communism in the 1960s. Around the same time, the CIA manipulated the National Student\n\nAssociation for intelligence gathering in other anti-communism efforts. But the privacy issue is more acute now\n\nthat the amount of student data in cloud-based systems has grown exponentially and is more widely dispersed.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n<p> The University's expertise over ethically regulated data collection and management, is better than government, business,\n\nand even medical domains for two reasons. First, the institution's long history and ethical motives with data are\n\nunique. The norms of data-handling have been codified through the University's Institutional Review Board based\n\non its\n\n<strong>stated mission</strong>. In other words, Universities take data seriously\n\n<i>for reasons other than corporate profit or governmental control</i>. An example of personal data precautions has\n\nplayed out with Harvard's recent data tiffs leading to the Supreme Court, illustrated by a 2016 article: </p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Last week undergraduates at Harvard University raised concerns about the institution handing over their data to an\n\nanti-affirmative action group as part of a lawsuit. Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing the university\n\nfor allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants, will have access to “academic, extracurricular,\n\ndemographic and other information” from all undergrads who applied to Harvard between the fall 2009 and spring 2015,\n\nomitting names and Social Security numbers.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>The second reason why Universities understand ethical implications for data is that data and more broadly data and\n\nhuman information\n\n<i>research</i> is the institutions' second highest priority, along with teaching and service. For example, in response\n\nto the unethical Public Health research in\n\n<i>Tuskegee Syphilis experiements</i>, the University instution\n\n<i>stepped in</i> to help design the 1978\n\n<strong>Belmont Principles</strong>. Currently, the University Institutional Review Board incorporates this with the Nuremburg\n\nCode (developed after WWII NAZI research), in handling data research.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>In recent days,\n\n<i>private companies</i> claim expertise for regulating \"Fake News\", and you guessed it,\n\n<strong>regulation of data privacy &amp; confidentiality.</strong><sup>3</sup> The ethical authority over data privacy norms are nowhere\n\nelse than the University campus, case in point Harvard... Let the governments govern and the enterprises enterprise,\n\nand leave the\n\n<i>thoughtful, ethical regulation of data collection and precaution </i> to the Ivory Tower.

Traditionally, outside \"miners\" validate the block's\n\n<i> transaction records</i> as it replicates to the next \"block.\" For example, a transaction is validated 2 or three\n\ntimes, and since three miners' validations all agree, one is kept and two are destroyed, in a nutshell; one example\n\nof computations (\n\n<strong>and hence coal</strong>) that cost too much time and energy.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike this arrangement, Iota, Ripple, and Hedera use a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) data structure (shaped like\n\na sideways genealogy tree) that relies on \"consensus\" from its nearest neighbor transaction nodes.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>Enough with the jargon! The bottom line is that Bitcoin's tech is not eco-sustainable,\n\n<sup>2</sup> and so alternatives are already closing in on Bitcoin. Iota, the 8th largest cryptocurrency Iota delivers\n\nopen-source transparency, lightning speed, and yet is it cryptographically sound? Not according to some tech pundits:\n\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">You might think that IOTA, a cryptocurrency worth over a billion dollars, and working with organizations like Microsoft,\n\nUniversity College London, Innogy, and Bosch, BNY Mellon, Cisco, and Foxconn (through the Trusted IOT Alliance)\n\nwould not have fairly obvious vulnerabilities, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. When we took a look at their\n\nsystem, we found a serious vulnerability and textbook insecure code.\n\n<br />\n\n<br /> “In 2017, leaving your crypto algorithm vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis is a rookie mistake. It says that\n\nno one of any calibre analyzed their system, and that the odds that their fix makes the system secure is low,” states\n\nBruce Schneier, renowned security technologist, about IOTA when we shared our attack.\n\n<sup>3</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>And so, with a 1.9 billion market cap, I sometimes have to reflect on the immensity and non-relational fact and figures\n\nof our technological world! Security and other bugs are hard to avoid when an industry is moving too fast for thoroughly\n\ntested betas; and each iteration involves a series of bug-patches, with short- and long-term priorities stretched\n\nwith new design &amp; function trade-offs.</p>\n\n<p>\n\nFull life-cycle software development, from napkin-idea to rolling specs, always follows these patterns yet not always with\n\nso much money on the line! Here's a closer look at one critique of Iota:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\nIOTA developers had written their own hash function, it was a huge red flag ... I think it’s important to reiterate that\n\nthe IOTA developers do not agree with our characterization of this as an issue of concern. Our report lays out more\n\ndetails about why we are concerned.\n\n<br />\n\n<br /> There are other red flags — unlike every other program running on your laptop or phone, IOTA uses ternary instead\n\nof binary. Since all computer hardware today uses binary, IOTA converts to ternary in software, which is less efficient\n\nand more complex. This complexity prevents IOTA from benefiting from existing security analysis tools that are designed\n\nto work with binary, and makes the code harder to read and understand.\n\n<br />\n\n<br /> The current IOTA tangle requires a trusted party (the coordinator) for security, suggesting that in its current\n\nform it’s not ready to run as a truly permissionless, decentralized system.\n\n<sup>3</sup>\n\n</p><p>\n\nOptimizing, not sacrificing, should be the name of the game as Tech closes in on Blockchain challenges of security, scalability,\n\nand that evers-so-costly\n\n<strong>Sustainability!</strong>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>1.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/next-generation-crypto-ledgers-take-the-block-out-of-blockchain\"\n\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/next-generation-crypto-ledgers-take-the-block-out-of-blockchain</a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\n\n<a href=\"\n\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\n\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>3.\n\n<a href=\"\n\nhttps://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367\n\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367</a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"18-03-16\" class=\"  mar 18-03 -17\">\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"  chapternumber\">March 16, 2018</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come\n\n</h6>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Sustainability for the environment means an accelerated transition to renewables.

Nielsen recently released numbers indicating\n\nsubstantial drops in both CD and digital-track sales, which are down almost $100 million\n\n<i>year over year</i> from 2014; streaming music continues to grow, but the revenue it generates isn’t close to making\n\nup the difference, yet.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>Most remember Taylor Swift's 2014 industry-shaking album withdraw in protest to Spotify's payment structure.

These wins are amazing but not enough, if only for winning battles in a losing war. </p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Spotify is the future. Spotify is the enemy. Spotify doesn’t pay enough. Spotify is music’s best bet for revenue\n\ngrowth. Since it arrived in the United States from Sweden in 2011, Spotify has been cast as both hero and villain\n\nin the music industry’s continuing debate over streaming music. </p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\nIt has been hailed as a potential savior through a two-tiered “freemium” model that would gradually lure listeners away from\n\npiracy. Yet Spotify’s royalty rates have also terrified many artists already worried that each new step in music’s\n\ndigital evolution further devalues their work.\n\n<sup>3</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>So the trend looks dire, and yet is it really? Where, just where are the\n\n<strong>Tech Platforms </strong> leading us? Tech is leading us\n\n<i>nowhere</i>, at least not to one\n\n<strong>singular, centralized place</strong>; rather, decentralized tech--including but not limited to blockchain--is busy\n\nrewriting the boundaries between creators and consumers.

Patreon paid out $150 million to its artists in 2017, and each are doubling\n\nannually. Decentralizing again.

This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore's 49.8!</p>\n\n<p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to\n\n<i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking:\n\nDenial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot),\n\nso the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle. </p>\n\n<p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly,\n\nthis is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950's (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating\n\nsystem. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nNext, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of \"fairness\" because blockchain transactions are\n\n<i>\n\n<strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i> Bitcoin transactions are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle,\n\nwhich is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p>\n\n<p>\n\nSwirld's unveiled their consensus-based\n\n<strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has now been announced to\n\ndeploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news! Tremendous, since I explained\n\nin my\n\n<a href=\"#18-03-01\">March 1st </a> blog post that older blockchain technologies incentivize miners' efforts by directly tying electrical-cost(\n\n(in calculations) to the Bitcoin/hour profit margin. For this reason, the future horizon just considerably shortened\n\nBitcoin's runway for establishing anything beyond \"early-adopter\" status. </p>\n\n<p>So, we'll see if the innovating crew with Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum can successfully alter the crypto algorithm\n\ninto it's planned carbon-free consensus-based, \"proof-of-stake\" form. For the moment, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other\n\nelectricity-draining \"proof-of-work\" designs, have their\n\n<strong>exchange value trapped inside their own Carbon Footprint</strong>.\n\n<sup>4</sup> And so, because environmental sustainablity is foremost of concerns for future investment, survival may\n\ndepend on digging out of that Carbon Footprint much more quickly!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-thinks-it-can-one-up-bitcoin-and-ethereum-with-faster-transactions/#175e5c79abcb\">\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-thinks-it-can-one-up-bitcoin-and-ethereum-with-faster-transactions/#175e5c79abcb\n\n</a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/hedera-hashgraph-swirlds-no-fork-guarantee-cryptocurrency-touts-resistance-code-splits/\"\n\ntarget=\"_blank\">\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/hedera-hashgraph-swirlds-no-fork-guarantee-cryptocurrency-touts-resistance-code-splits/</a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.\n\n<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-and-mz-unveil-next-generation-blockchain-alternative/\"\n\ntarget=\"_blank\">\n\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-and-mz-unveil-next-generation-blockchain-alternative/</a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>4.\n\n<a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/</a>\n\n</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mar 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-03-12\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h4 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">March 12, 2018</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:\n\n<br /> Part II and New Forms of Trust</h6>\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">\n\nThroughout the centralized-tech period of the\n\n<i>mobile-powered </i> Web 2.0, most Sharing transactions take place on a centralized platform that simply facilitates\n\nthe peer-to-peer transactions.

Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer\n\nmarketplaces,\n\n<i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer\n\nof resources. By either sense, the\n\n<i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media,\n\ninternet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s\n\n<i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods\n\nand services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In\n\n<i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how\n\nthe\n\n<strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>.\n\n<sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3) breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general\n\npurpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power,\n\nsources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first condition: New forms of communication to\n\n<i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second\n\ncondition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition:\n\nNew methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving\n\nsolar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated,\n\ndriverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new\n\ntechnology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s\n\ninnovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in\n\nthe present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively\n\nthe New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how can we change the way we\n\n<i>think</i> and how we\n\n<i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on\n\n<strong>\n\n<i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i>\n\n</strong>\n\n<sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will\n\na New Paradigm Shift emerge. In this occasion however, we as a society may not have the luxury of decades to adapt\n\nto New Technologies, as the carbon hangover from the previous Industrial Era imperils the safe arrival of the next!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/</a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/node/21553017\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.economist.com/node/21553017</a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.\n\n<a href=\"https://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf\"\n\ntarget=\"_blank\">3.

This means that every institution, whether private hospitals, non-profit charity\n\nfoundations, or government bureaus, will effectively restructure (optimize) their own organizational structure in\n\nan increasingly\n\n<i>data-driven</i> paradigm. From a Sociology of Organizations perspective, the changes to come are breath-taking to\n\nconsider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why women? Where could I start? Better stated, why is a quintessentially important job sector, a sector in desperate\n\nneed for insight, comprised primarily of men?\n\n<sup id=\"one\">1</sup> The facts are evident: ~15-20% of women comprising tech positions.\n\n<sup id=\"two\">2</sup> Numbers aside, I argue there is a quintessential societal need for more women in tech: This is because computing\n\nand understanding data has changed since the data collection from Web 2.0 (mobile), becoming more networked and\n\nrelational.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge for society in this age is historic, and women must absolutely be included in the process of the age:\n\nPlease consider, that in the 1650&#39;s, the invention of the microscope opened a new world of data and\n\n<i>information</i> about the bacteriological, microscopic surroundings--hitherto blind to all. Likewise, the telescope\n\nhas allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage)\n\na universe of knowledge--about\n\n<i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the\n\ndata to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the\n\n<i>output</i> can be\n\n<i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the\n\nkey challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables. This is akin\n\nto finding a needle in an increasingly complex and growing haystack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">What&#39;s different now and has changed is it&#39;s no longer about taking this data, putting it into a computer\n\nrunning a calculation and getting a balance sheet answer ...</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">What&#39;s important now is what is the context of the data, what is it connected to, what effect is it having on\n\ndata around it... It&#39;s basically a network of the data, it&#39;s no longer sort of tabular columns, of rows\n\nof data, it&#39;s\n\n<i>interconnected patterns</i>.\n\n<br /> --Tim Cook</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This quote means that as we move away from rule-based, mechanistic data analytics toward more complex, relational\n\nand networked data, we need an equally complex paradigm to keep up. Excluding the female mind from this challenge\n\nis not simply a clumsy, myopic mistake. Worse yet, so long as the Tech Industry remains gender lop-sided, Tech will\n\nincreasingly resemble another myopic beast, a cave-dweller named Cyclops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html</a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.\n\n<a href=\"https://fairygodboss.com/articles/women-in-tech-facts-figures-and-percentages\" target=\"_blank\">https://fairygodboss.com/articles/women-in-tech-facts-figures-and-percentages</a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/</a>\n\n</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mar 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-03-07\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">March 7, 2018</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">About the April 23 Implementation of the FCC Net Neutrality Laws:\n\n<br /> The Coming Battle of States&#39; versus Federal Rights Part II</h6>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Washington&#39;s assertion of States&#39; Rights yesterday may augur the first of many lawsuits over control over\n\nbandwidth.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mar 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-03-06\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">March 6, 2018</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">April 23 Implementation of the FCC Net Neutrality Laws:\n\n<br /> The Coming Battle of States&#39; versus Federal Rights</h6>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Net Neutrality Rules, potentially one of the more important set of Individual Rights for us as citizens in the tech\n\nage, will soon undergo the rule changes voted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) this past December.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Internet Service Providers (ISP&#39;s), e.g. Comcast, Cox, Verizon are granted the power--as\n\na Title I &quot;information service&quot;--to slow down traffic, make fast- &amp; slow-lanes.

Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era\n\n<sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any\n\nmedical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39;\n\nsurface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively,\n\nand provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics\n\nare\n\n<i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating\n\nstrains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies\n\nrelied on a misleading methodology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations\n\nin the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which\n\nmanufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while\n\nit is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu\n\nvirus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu\n\n<i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with\n\n<i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses\n\nthat happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that\n\nare pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic\n\ntree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system\n\nexposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond\n\n<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular\n\nperiod each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal\n\ntime-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further\n\naway on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a\n\n<i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also\n\nprovides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain\n\nmath can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort\n\nof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each\n\nother, then conditional upon other factors. This being\n\n<i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e\n\nthings: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any\n\n<i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions\n\nabout a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our\n\nsciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The\n\nfirst of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of\n\nwhich gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating\n\n<i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better\n\nhandle on the multiple effects of\n\n<sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large\n\nNumbers\n\n<sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new\n\n<strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the\n\n<i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician\n\nout there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n<p>1.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail </a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.\n\n<a href=\"https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual\" target=\"_blank\"> https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual </a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm </a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mar 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-03-03\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">March 3-4, 2018\n\n<br /> Weekend\n\n</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel</h6>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Back in 1997, a Pulitzer-Prize winning theory--based on Dr. Jared Diamond&#39;s\n\n<i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies</i> --provided the recipe book for the success of societies.\n\nNot without controversy, the theory posits that geographic and environmental preconditions, once met, provide tech\n\n&amp; resources trading opportunities, within a network of other nation-states also vying for technogical innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A nation&#39;s Technology, in turn, opens the means necessary to expansive, stable, independent sovereignty that\n\nlasts and thrives.

While excessive ads were one reason\n\nfor the heat generation, the main cause was that the phone&#39;s CPU was hijacked to mine for Monero.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The larger issue here is that the lines between trusted mobile-app authorities, i.e., certified by Play Store or\n\nApple&#39;s is increasingly irrelevent. This is because an increasing number of app-users are ditching device-downloaded\n\napps, preferring for browser applications--hence, a much more appetizing market for the newest generation of blackhat\n\nhackers, online thieves, peeping-toms, and other ill-wishers.

This problem, experienced by\n\nthe top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the\n\n<i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the\n\n<i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity KiloWatt Hours\n\nper year.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Digiconomist succinctly writes:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a\n\nsolid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years\n\nthis has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of\n\nthe currency reached new highs.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, so the issue I&#39;m addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more\n\nequipment, and in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin&#39;s surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year\n\nusage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per year, respectively.\n\nIn other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner&#39;s cost (in electricity) compared with the miner&#39;s gain (in\n\nBitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper Carbon Footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin network has\n\nbeen increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start of November 2017, the Bitcoin\n\nEnergy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network to be half of the\n\ncurrent amount. On the first day of November, the estimated consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nCarbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner&#39;s electricity costs account for approximately\n\n65% of the profit (Bitcoin units&#39; value, measured when mined). So the\n\n<i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost\n\nof the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the\n\n<i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then\n\nperhaps the other edge looks preferred!\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\n\n<a href=\"\n\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\n\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.\n\n<a href=\"\n\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\n\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption </a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<button id=\"febtop\">TOP \n\nFEBRUARY \n\n<br />\n\n<h4>POSTS FEBRUARY 2018</h4>\n\n<br />\n\n<h6>First Blog Post!</h6>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-10\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 10, 2018</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6>First Blog Post!</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Why are Sociologists now the Key Players in Data Analysis within the Domain of Blockchain Technologies?</h6>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin and other\n\ncryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology (peer-to-peer global\n\nip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate, individual needs and uses.\n\nThese blockchain &quot;network&quot; analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network changes, node\n\nchanges, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships) that\n\ninclude arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain tech must face analytical\n\nchallenges that arise from informal practices\n\n<sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role&#39;s protocol for\n\nthe sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan&#39;s (1977)\n\n<i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple\n\n<i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time, convenience,\n\netc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm human understanding\n\n<i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of a bank, a person,\n\nor a company&#39;s internal bot?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought the\n\nworld the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can only contribute little on how to interface with social\n\nneeds. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the multi-dimensional layers\n\nof hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks? Well enough to differentiate qualitative\n\nmeaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved, integrated\n\nthrough multiple layers of &quot;middlemen&quot;, such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions, non-governmental,\n\nnon-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases the middlemen. Suddenly, one\n\nprogrammer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team\n\nof hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the life of\n\nthe contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years&#39; Sociology Network Analysts&#39;\n\nresearch and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and should not turn to the\n\nHard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already at home, safe within the academic\n\ndomain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology\n\ncan either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances, accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises.\n\nOr, the next ten years can follow Sociology&#39;s Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful\n\nfuture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on\n\nreview of the Sociologists&#39; specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships,\n\nwithin social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships.\n\nWe Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized\n\nby fixed patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes that characterize\n\nsocietal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large Number Statistical Theory\n\nbecome consumated with the brilliance of early 1900&#39;s Sociological French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach&#39;s\n\nwork on the clearly defined network patterns of a society&#39;s Collective Memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic&#39;s &quot;irrational\n\nbehaviors&quot; and Mathematical &quot;complexity models&quot; do not\n\n<i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate simultaneous\n\nnode changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups\n\nget jobs), and most importantly the\n\n<i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time and fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fine. So, why is Sociology&#39;s network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th and\n\n20th centuries&#39; network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era, while North\n\nAmerican Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960&#39;s [post-1968], U.S. in the 1990&#39;s[post-1999],\n\nin the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of past sociology are inherently small-data and\n\nmore qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates &quot;human-ness&quot; into the billion rows and\n\ncolumns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation\n\nfor Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of each relationship\n\n(link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is\n\npossible to isolate directional, conditional\n\n<i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation\n\n<sup id=\"9one\">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on social networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person\n\n<i>self-selects </i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group&#39;s\n\nbehavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group&#39;s behavior,\n\nby the group&#39;s influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder&#39;s SIENA software, achieves\n\nthe impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology. The network graph\n\ncan be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not\n\nas personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes\n\n(social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount\n\nof missing data</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear, directed\n\npath of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists are called upon,\n\nblockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again the same bugs. Sadly, this\n\nsemi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain for their currency, contract,\n\nand other societal needs--in this case, the blind will indeed lead the blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"footnotes\">1.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/226550\" id=\"9one\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/226550</a>\n\n<br />\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n2.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/\" id=\"9one\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/</a>\n\n</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-11\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 11, 2018</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">How Can We Best Modularize our App Designs in Order to Achieve the Much Vaunted &quot;Separation of Concerns&quot;?</h6>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed Order of\n\nCoders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from structural design.\n\nHence, in the early 2000&#39;s, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to abide by The scaffolding\n\nof HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we must throw out this antiquated division\n\nof labor within web coding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules and components\n\nMust hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled html, js, css, it is now requisite\n\nto divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and\n\n<i>\n\neach</i> of these component teams\n\n<strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module&#39;s required html, js, css.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and\n\nall coding will necessarily begin to &#39;reinvent the wheel.&#39; This is because any module, any library you go\n\nto, will\n\n<i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate new\n\ncss from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual misery, almost\n\ninstantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher level of abstraction,\n\nleaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice in the modern world, and if\n\nad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity? If yesterday&#39;s craft was the\n\nhoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part\n\nby part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and\n\npastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module\n\ndefinition? That&#39;s absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an age that\n\neach year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic sugar and also fundamental\n\nstructure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us\n\nto a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the &quot;Separation of Concerns.&quot; We can allow ourselves\n\na break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must\n\n<i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create!</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-12\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 12, 2018</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s Innocence</h6>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Facebook Scandals\n\n<sup>1</sup> of recent months have demoralized the leadership for a role of misinformation in the Tech Age, however I\n\ncharge Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s innocence\n\n<i>not</i> because all of us, as a society, were equally warned. Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created abnormal,\n\nnever-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were so efficient at multiplying\n\nand exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social\n\nlearning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial\n\n<sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation were\n\nnot entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural changes from\n\nhigher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in their content and influence)\n\nbegin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes\n\ndominated by the relationships, e.g., the &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;shares&quot;, leading to a statistically natural\n\npropensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel\n\nto the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal\n\nand tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary\n\n<i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual &quot;interruptions&quot; that\n\npreviously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication that the\n\ntimespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation Bias, misinformation\n\nand outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that are already hard to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,\n\n<i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network phenomonenon--ultimately\n\ndriven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry, conditional influences, and\n\nthe strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these factors, our social inclinations were\n\n<i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network phenomena\n\n-- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"footnotes\">1.

The past 50 years&#39; social changes and new problems are generally atrributed\n\nfor the increasing demand for sociological expertise after 1999, after a singular, senseless tragedy of a school\n\nshooting--this event, like a small kernel of societal desperation for a solution--led to a flurry of self-professed\n\nsociologists &agrave; la Michael Moore&#39;s Colombine, and other social-responsibility themed social consciousness.\n\nSo far, only mutually incompatible solutions.

Sure, it&#39;s more\n\nof a &quot;metropolitan&quot; phenomenon; and sure, it&#39;s become an accepted global platform--along with myriad\n\nother crypto-currencies, but it&#39;s exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies\n\nare useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency&#39;s rise to\n\nfame with last year&#39;s increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its contributions,\n\nuses, fame are one-sidedly\n\n<i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article\n\n<sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of\n\n<i>actual</i> use at the &quot;cash-registers&quot; of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological\n\n<i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Rogers&#39;\n\n<i>Diffusion of Innovations</i>\n\n<sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger&#39;s bell curve\n\nranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However, the blockchain\n\narticles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine usefulness for the\n\nevery-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is\n\n<i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific information--whether\n\nfinancial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order before I continue, since we can\n\nall relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most notably concerning Target store credit card\n\nhacks a couple years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions,\n\nthis person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction:\n\nthey prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that $27, $200,\n\nor $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their\n\n<i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and if the store&#39;s\n\ndatabases are hacked, then tough-luck!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for each transaction,\n\nproviding the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient! Nobody thinks to walk around\n\nwith their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit\n\ncard system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions\n\nhave had to rely on the many layers of security, passwords, pins, mothers&#39; maiden names, etc. Then, based on\n\nthe mathematics behind prime numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright\n\nred target on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And that, my\n\nfriends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency, instead\n\nthe crypto-\n\n<i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero&#39;s name\n\nis the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide pinpointed,\n\n<i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for the sake of\n\nrenting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don&#39;t need this. They need\n\nto know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire governmental database of information\n\nabout you!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-big-in-investing-but-still-lousy-for-buying-a-sandwich/\"\n\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-big-in-investing-but-still-lousy-for-buying-a-sandwich/</a>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.\n\n<a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED065999\" target=\"_blank\">Rogers, E.

Who do we think programmers are, sociologists?\n\nMore specifically, who could know\n\n<i>which</i> mundane coding practices, arbitrary app-design--like sharing permissions/features? Sure, everyone deep\n\ndown knew their company practices yield unfathomable power of influence over the daily habits of cell-users, a.k.a.\n\neveryone.

However, if the current logistical obstacles provide controversy and competing algorithms\n\nover sustainability, security, and scalability, then they reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses\n\n(and potential effects) than they hide. In my February 15th\n\n<a href=\"#18-02-15\">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects of the\n\ncrypto-contract horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Prologue</strong>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the\n\n<i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals? First, a\n\nlittle background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum blockchain helps distinguish\n\nitself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech, like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based\n\nblockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming features, e.g. &quot;looping&quot;, &quot;recursion&quot;,\n\nwith the full power of a\n\n<i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the accounting\n\nsystem of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction, An Ethereum\n\nblockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,\n\n<i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks to calculate\n\ninto a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, Ethereum&#39;s Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum\n\nblockchain is actually a &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, like a a big networked &quot;home computer&quot;. The native\n\nlanguage of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an\n\n<i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home computer,\n\nthen directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman&#39;s terms, the manner that modern-day app,\n\nfor example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one programming system\n\nto interact with another, such as Instragram offers a &quot;sharing API&quot; that connects to hardware contacts,\n\nthus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook\n\naccount, via your T-Mobile phone&#39;s contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we\n\nlive in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system,\n\nwhich exchanges API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity\n\ndays; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise. The reason\n\nbeing that digital math uses binary &quot;on/off&quot; calculations, while quantum math implicates a tertiary,\n\n<i>qubit</i> &quot;simultaneous states&quot;. Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology,\n\nboth programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA&#39;s blockchain\n\ndesign utilizes a\n\n<i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one&#39;s transaction is entered into with a private-key, and the blockchain\n\nmoreso resembles a &quot;Tangle&quot; of a directed graph, which allows for computational &quot;states&quot;. IOTA\n\nrecently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent vulnerability.\n\nIn truth, this was a case of user-error because users were\n\n<i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer could\n\ncrack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough now to cause\n\ndamage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Social\n\nuseablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun to emerge, at least in form,\n\nwith little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd generation Patrician directed graph blockchain.\n\nThe underlying principle of the blockchain&#39;s micro-economic utiliity through crypto-\n\n<i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions for Supply\n\n&amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of the Hard Sciences of\n\nMathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-19\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech\">OUR DAILY TECH</h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 19, 20189</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Blockchains, Bitcoins and The Unnecessary Risk of Shopping at Target with a Credit Card, Part III:\n\n<br />\n\n<br /> Seven Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy\n\n<br />\n\n<small class=\"jargon\">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity!

Then, the primacy of the\n\n<i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then other Paradigm\n\nShifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment authors of 17th, 18th\n\ncentury. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era&#39;s emerging paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority\n\nand responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment.\n\n<i>Historical Materialism</i>\n\n<sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from governmental,\n\nfinancial sources, but rather the\n\n<i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the revolutionary\n\nshift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable data-sharing. Cryptography\n\nhas in a sense become a\n\n<i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong>\n\n<br /> Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical proof, rather\n\nthan exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern period also has held this\n\ndecentralized, individual authority as the\n\n<i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions of humankind,\n\nnot idealogies. In fact, it was the\n\n<i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western Philosophy,\n\nby laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical &quot;ground&quot; upward. This &quot;upside-down\n\ntree&quot; defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of\n\n<i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism, as argued\n\nin Sartre&#39;s\n\n<i>Search for a Method</i>.\n\n<sup>3</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations since Hegel.\n\nI&#39;m so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels. First, cryptography\n\nresemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern social rule (Some once thought\n\nnuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown. Secondly, I&#39;m still dumbfounded that\n\na Paradigm Shift\n\n<i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for a society that\n\nis provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon thousands of\n\nopen-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum Virtual Machine, whose\n\naims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for removing the &quot;middle-person&quot;\n\nfrom the day-to-day, micro-economic &quot;cost of living&quot;. This goes for for the exchanging of titles, legal\n\ndocuments, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing necessity in allocating\n\nincreasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of\n\n<i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms on the near\n\nhorizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on\n\n<i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient by means of\n\nblockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>III. Removing Double-Dipping from International Remittances </strong>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<i>&quot;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&quot;\n\n</i>\n\n<br /> --Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, 1939</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute;\n\nla Western Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. The existing remittance system (not speaking\n\nto\n\n<i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian friend&#39;s\n\nCanadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national payments systems,\n\nthus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut.

The 4th through 7th outlined Features of the New Blockchain\n\nMicro-Economy</small>\n\n</h6>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">I feel that data is one of the more underestimated new commodities of the age. Most visualize data as rows and columns,\n\nand at most only non-conditional dynamic data. Data are not so mute! Data, in most object-oriented languages at\n\nleast, represents\n\n<i>functions</i>, conditions, and predicted values. And so, our own behavior, coupled with our networks&#39; behavior,\n\ncoupled with predictive analytics--this represents a wealth of information beyond our attributed or inherited traits.\n\nThe programming is\n\n<i>in</i> the data, however, citizens have become less and less involved, ceding app by centralized app our own information\n\nand ensuring profit to 3rd party marketers. The centralized nature of the internet allows for this, while the new\n\nlandscape of\n\n<i>decentralized applications</i> (DAPP) completely upends this structure of the status quo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>IV. Enabling citizens to own &amp; monetize their data (&amp; protect privacy)</strong>\n\n<br /> Ethereum offers a decentralized solution to &quot;owning&quot; one&#39;s own data, as data can be decentralized\n\nand returned to the individual&#39;s control, and\n\n<i>profit</i>. As sure as the 19th century&#39;s &quot;labor-hour&quot; became commodified to a calculable asset, i.e.\n\nproperty, which\n\n<i>another</i> party controls and makes profit; And as sure as the 20th century&#39;s data analytics became commodified\n\ninto calculable assets for another party to take control and make profit; then only now in this 21st century does\n\ntechnology offer a new, more egalitarian path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>V. Ensuring compensation for the Creators of Value </strong>\n\n<br /> So, how would decentralized innovations of blockchain\n\n<i>distributed ledger</i> technology compensate those whose actions, behavior, opinions, friend-networks, artwork,\n\nmusic, videos and other contributions profit the creator?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>VI. The Halcyon Age of Transaction-Chain Enterprise</strong>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">According to Greek Mythology, the days of eery, noticeable lack of storms have never been interpreted as a period\n\nof grace. Moreso,\n\n<i>Halcyon</i> tranquility only means a temporary moratorium on the winds and waves, imposed by Aeolus, God of Wind,\n\nto protect the nesting eggs of Alcyone, his daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If blockchain tech changes how we do research, analysis, and forecasting, as much as it changes international, and\n\ncross-industry transactions, then are we faced with a similar dilemma as the &quot;novelty&quot;, and double-dealing,\n\nof multi-nationals of the 1990s? No, because blockchain renders organizations, even those with a spotty past, into\n\ntransparent, democratic, efficient, secure and easily scrutinized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, without transparent proof, how else would I know my bananas are the &quot;pura vida&quot; Costa Rique&ntilde;\n\nones? More importantly, what was the carbon footprint of that banana&#39;s journey from its native soil to my breakfast\n\ntable? New blockchain companies like\n\n<a href=\"https://www.provenance.org/\">Provenance.org</a>,\n\n<a href=\"http://www.skuchain.com/\" target=\"_blank\">skuchain</a>,\n\n<a href=\"http://www.blockverify.io/\">http://www.blockverify.io/</a> are a few noticeable game-changers. So, for bananas not backed by mathematical proofs,\n\nI really have to ask myself, is it\n\n<i>really</i> an authentic Fair Trade banana?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transactions are hardly valuable in the products themselves, if removed from the value of the\n\n<i>transaction per se</i>. International supply chain transactions, by virtue of a recently possible decentralized,\n\npermanent record and monitoring, have begun to make inroads in agriculture, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, food-supply\n\nand other multi-stage industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If corporate and governmental transactions are to be made public--many bearing enterprise or State secrets, then\n\nwill forecasting also go the way of birds? Possibly. Online platforms like Augur\n\n<sup id=\"20-8\">8</sup>are creating global, decentralized prediction markets, in domains like sports betting, financial markets\n\nspeculation and so forth. Armed with vast, transparent knowledge, the everyday person can now access the whims and\n\npower of Aeolus, and forecasting the winds of Fortune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>VII.

With all our technology, we just can&#39;t wait to hear the latest\n\ngossip about sister Becky&#39;s Boyfriend&#39;s Brother&#39;s Friend that\n\n<i>also</i> got to meet Shakira. Gossip to one person is a valuable asset to the data analyst. Because, how else could\n\nan algorithm draw simultaneous conclusions about two friends that &quot;liked&quot; the same Samsung VR, and that\n\nthey are both located near Best Buy. Thanks to classificatorial wisdom of AI &amp; plain machine-learning?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These relational queries are simply too difficult for relational, row &amp; column SQL data structures. In fact,\n\nmany queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures. Next, with the need to &quot;objectify&quot;\n\ndata into non-relational objects, rather than an antiquated, rigid row-and-column design. Thus, the second major\n\ntype of data structure is more flexible and adept in finding these relational queries that are ever more in vogue.\n\nHowever, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational, No-SQL designs quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability.\n\nBetween a rock and a hard place, a third data structure has emerged in recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graph Data Structures\n\n<sup>2</sup> allow data queries that had otherwise been impossible to capture in an entity relationship diagram. The\n\nideal example to clarify is the manner that the Swiss banks&#39; accounts were discovered to be hiding vast amounts\n\nof hidden taxes, etc. The cover-up was so well-constructed that not until new, graph database queries discovered\n\npatterns of money flow\n\n<sup>1</sup>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">The data was then turned into a graph format to detect then fine-tune the connections between the nodes. The Swiss\n\nLeak held around 60,000 files that contained information about over 100,000 clients in 203 countries, which means\n\nthat the resulting graph database had more than 275,000 nodes with 400,000 relationships among them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections\n\nthan they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and regulators\n\nacross the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you thought that plagiarism-detecting software was impressive for complexity! The beauty of this newly available\n\nsoftware (even Microsoft jumped on board in recent years) means that sociologists, economists can begin to make\n\nbetter headway in the way that our many interactions become more complex with more data. Remember, in the past ten\n\nminutes, more data information was just produced than most of human history! Thus, new and upcoming needs in domains\n\nlike content management &amp; access control, geo-routing (public transportation), gene sequencing, bio-informatics,\n\nand so on.

Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated speed of language and syntax formation,\n\nand the curious phenomenon I&#39;d call, for lack of a better word or or my own reading, &quot;declarative-syntax-merging&quot;.\n\nThis involves the curious, and largely unknown, growth of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain\n\nof web apps, data analysis, and even the bounds of\n\n<i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won&#39;t submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say that, &quot;If\n\na certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed in JavaScript.&quot;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without getting into technicals, I&#39;ll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged with\n\nFrench, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand years later,\n\nwe can see how English grammar inherited it&#39;s Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the core vocabulary;\n\nThen, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;house&quot;\n\nfrom &quot;melche&quot; or &quot;haus&quot;, then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from\n\nFrench, e.g. &quot;lactose&quot; or &quot;mansion&quot; from &quot;lait&quot; or &quot;maison&quot;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new language called\n\nSolidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English&#39;s time. The usual FOMO logic propels coding language use,\n\nfor example FOMO induced Microsoft&#39;s flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt it years ago.\n\n<sup id=\"22-1\">1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents, one non-legitimate.\n\nIt is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of C++. For the layperson, let&#39;s\n\njust say Solidity resembles a &quot;Liger&quot;, in it is at it&#39;s core JavaScript, yet with increasing sophistication\n\nbased on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the powerful machine-code of C++ ever more. And it\n\nis a beautiful, but curious phenomonenon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/microsoft-adds-ethereum-language-solidity-visual-studio-1552171\">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/microsoft-adds-ethereum-language-solidity-visual-studio-1552171</a>\n\n</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-23\">\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#top2\"><button>Top</button></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech\">OUR DAILY TECH</h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 23, 2018</h6>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">1.4 Million Reasons for more Women in Tech</h6>\n\n<a href=\"#18-03-08\" rel=\"stylesheet\">Blog addressed again March 8, 2018 </a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">1.4 million\n\n<i>new</i> jobs by 2020; End over end, year after year, the computer programming industry continues to add another\n\n20% more jobs each year, for the next five years. This is the only field that demand outstrips the supply--and increasingly\n\nshort supply. So much so, the US Department of Labor forecasts U.S. citizens will be able to fill 39% of those positions;\n\nthere are not enough Immigration visas (especially in the Trumpian era of isolationism) to make up the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how is it that only 14% of females in the entire field of cybersecurity? Silicon Valley is, at its best, obscenely\n\none-sided. At Google, only 17% of the company&#39;s tech jobs are filled by women. Facebook women staff only 15%\n\nof tech jobs, and Twitter? 10% female. The figures on women in computer science across the nation, across the entire\n\nindustry are not improving, but\n\n<i>declining</i>?\n\n<sup>1</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we&#39;ve heard these statistics from any given headline, and in the halls across the university landscape,\n\nstarting with Women in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Mathematics) programs.\n\n<sup>3</sup> Yet, why, with so much money, so many programs, so many non-governmental, non-profit effort?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I argue that tech\n\n<i>climate </i> is directly to blame. Who then? Not a person, but principles are to blame. Culture--often defined as\n\nshared beliefs, norms, language and behaviors--can hardly be changed, but it can be understood.\n\n<br /> There is a book, called &quot;Program or be Programmed\n\n<sup id=\"24-4\">4</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n, by which the author explains social consequences of a dichotomized society--between those that manipulate the environment\n\naround them, whether automating tasks at work, or simply fixing a simple software bug, by adding a comma. This literacy\n\nof the Current Era is akin to the 26-letter alphabet of written sentences and paragraphs, and--not to be taken for\n\ngranted--is the exclusive form of communication, outside of a 100-foot perimeter, up until 150 years ago. Knowledge\n\nis not power, the communication of knowledge is power.\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I argue that today, the power is to program one application programming interface (API) to talk to another API. In\n\nother words, the ability to directly communicate with software at the command-line is not now a requisite skill,\n\nbut promotions would not escape this necessity! So, now reverting back to the subject of women in tech, American\n\nleadership is in deep peril without more female insight.

Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously\n\nas I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether I change my\n\nways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely, Sustainability, a.k.a.\n\nCarbon Footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms that build\n\na record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a bitcoin for their efforts.\n\n<sup id=\"explain\">1</sup>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high electricity\n\nbills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity is gobbled up by small\n\nand large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations!\n\n<sup id=\"electricity\">1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other &quot;Proof-of-Work&quot; designs require electricity because\n\nthe investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for mining drives\n\nthe system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is the electricity consumption really\n\n<i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis site\n\n<sup\n\nid=\"digiconomist\">3</sup> estimates\n\n<i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity&#39;s mining. (A visa credit card transaction\n\nis 0.00651 kWh. The entire Ethereum global blockchain could be &quot;using as much as 4.2 Terawatt-hours (tWh),\n\nor slightly more than the country of Cyprus\n\n<sup id=\"cyprus\">1</sup>.&quot; So, electricity comparisons are telling, but how does this relate to its environment impact, sustainability\n\nitself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon Footprint, our energy consumption index, can be compared to another element of scarcity, which dictates fluctuations\n\nin value: Gold. According to\n\n<i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household&#39;s Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article does\n\nthe math for us very succinctly:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just more energy-intensive, but also has\n\na bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon footprint for both.\n\nFor Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. For gold, we assume a carbon\n\nfootprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined\n\n<sup id=\"digiconomist2\">3</sup>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin&#39;s worth\n\nof Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2).

And, for all the pitfalls of Iota and the ever-evolving Ethereum (and ever-present threat of forking), Bitcoin stands true among the crypto-currency platforms. Keeping it Simple,   the very limited, non-crypto-contract may just be Bitcoin's virtue. In a rocky world, <i>a plain, no-frills crypto-currency with stability</i> is incomparable to crypto-contract powers, that are not fully stable, like Ethereum and Iota.  </p>\r\n<p>So, it's living the dream, but must it be so cost-intensive? Maybe, Maybe not, but where does the future lie for all that hardware? Where does the browser fit into this? First, what's going on under the hood: Note this article is older, but accurate in explanation--except for references to Bitcoin's value! </p>  \r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">New bitcoins are created roughly every 10 minutes in batches of 25 coins, with each coin worth around $730 at current rates. [A typical home-] computer ... is racing thousands of others to unlock and claim the next batch.</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\nLet’s start with what it’s not doing.  \r\nYour computer is not blasting through the cavernous depths of the internet in search of digital ore that can be fashioned into bitcoin bullion. There is no ore, and bitcoin mining doesn’t involve extracting or smelting anything. It’s called mining only because the people who do it are the ones who get new bitcoins, and because bitcoin is a finite resource liberated in small amounts over time, like gold, or anything else that is mined. (The size of each batch of coins drops by half roughly every four years, and around 2140, it will be cut to zero, capping the total number of bitcoins in circulation at 21 million.) But the analogy ends there.\r\n</p><p class=\"quote\">\r\nWhat bitcoin miners actually do could be better described as competitive bookkeeping. Miners build and maintain a gigantic public ledger containing a record of every bitcoin transaction in history. Every time somebody wants to send bitcoins to somebody else, the transfer has to be validated by miners: They check the ledger to make sure the sender isn’t transferring money she doesn’t have. If the transfer checks out, miners add it to the ledger. Finally, to protect that ledger from getting hacked, miners seal it behind layers and layers of computational work—too much for a would-be fraudster to possibly complete.<sup>1</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So all of this hard work <i>can be distributed</i> across browsers, which improves its energy-expensive plight. I wouldn't recommend running the demo in the article link below as it may overheat your device--it had my fan running double-time. But the internals are using JavaScript code for the math. Here's a look under the hood, and it's nice to see the role of <i>JavaScript graphics library, called D3JS, (Data Driven Documents)</i> playing a central role. So, below you see the browser accepting the SHA256 Hash along with the Bitcoin Owner's Address, and the JavaScript in the browser passes off calculations to the C++ running the JavaScript V8 engine on your computer. </p>\r\n<img src=\"./dist/img/miningBlockchainD3.PNG\" class=\"zoom\" style=\"overflow:hidden;width:180%;\" />\r\n<p>And so, what does it mean to mine Bitcoins across browsers in a distributed fashion? It is similar to the same concept as Ethereum's direction (or at least idealized by its architect, Vitalik Buterin), in running the Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain across all the browsers that download its GETH software. Nonetheless, here's a succinct explanation of the browser's role,again from Quartz: </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Mining’s ultimate purpose is to prevent people from double-spending bitcoins. But it also solves another problem. It distributes new bitcoins in a relatively fair way—only those people who dedicate some effort to making bitcoin work get to enjoy the coins as they are created.\r\nBut because mining is a competitive enterprise, miners have come up with ways to gain an edge. One obvious way is by pooling resources.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\nYour machine, right now, is actually working as part of a bitcoin mining collective that shares out the computational load. Your computer is not trying to solve the block, at least not immediately. It is chipping away at a cryptographic problem, using the input at the top of the screen and combining it with a nonce [run-time, generated random number calculated only once, then discarded], then taking the hash to try to find a solution. Solving that problem is a lot easier than solving the block itself, but doing so gets the pool closer to finding a winning nonce for the block. And the pool pays its members in bitcoins for every one of these easier problems they solve.</p>\r\n<p>In practice, distributed mining pays off quite well   for the owners of that address.

Countless vulnerabilities, not to mention different standards and languages across the app world. <i>Like all Tech problems,</i>scalability requires Tech problem-solving--</i>in this case implying artificial intelligence.  About A.I., Zuckerberg remarks:</p>  \r\n  <p class=\"quote\"> There are some really nuanced questions, though, about how to regulate [data] which I think are extremely interesting intellectually. So the biggest one that I’ve been thinking about is this question of: To what extent should companies have a responsibility to use AI tools to kind of self-regulate content?<sup>1</sup>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>However such musing goes, the European Union's May 14th implementation takes a <i>direct stand against the concept of algorithm use with data</i>, which begs the A.I. question again. </p>\r\n  <p class=\"quote\">The European law gives individuals the right not to be subject to completely automated  decisions which significantly affect them. These decisions could include credit algorithms that use an individual’s data to decide whether a bank should grant him or her a loan.  \r\n      Privacy International said the clause on automated decisions could allow consumers to challenge Facebook practices like political advertising, which can be sent to users based on algorithms, because the ads are meant to sway users’ votes.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n  <p>I think the E.U. data policy model is intelligent - who would have thought to re-humanize our personal data   by taking it away from algorithms, without our permission. I like that, after all, who likes to be unknowingly judged?

The Path toward Sound Data Privacy Policy\r\n</h6> \r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Day two of Congressional hearings over Facebook's Data Privacy and Protections  were better articulated than the first day. Important dialogue surrounded primarily   two data privacy topics: First, financial transparency surrounding ads and political ads based on the <i>Honest Ads Act</i>, for which Zuckerberg pledged support<sup>1</sup>. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Second, and   more far-reaching, discussion of the <i>Browser Act</i> also was raised by several House members. While responding to the Act's sponsor, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Zuckerberg expressed interest in working together. This bill is not well known, but aims to set prudent, consistent guidelines of privacy in the hands of the consumer. </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\"> [Blackburn's] new bill targets the full spectrum of the internet, including web giants like Amazon and Google. In Blackburn’s words, it moves the government “to a posture where we have one regulator, one set of rules [and] everybody knows who’s in charge,” she told Recode.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<p>So, however the power struggle goes, a <i>shared technology lexicon</i> clarifies that shades of meaning make enormous difference, depending on \"what\" an entity is--whether a technology is a Platform as a Service  versus media outlet or strictly merchant-based. Hopefully, <i>Tech will lead the way</i> without ceding authority in the process: </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\n  But the Tennessee lawmaker’s effort hasn’t won any allies among privacy-conscious consumer groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, which doubt Blackburn’s methods. And her bill has already prompted a whole new round of fierce lobbying by tech and telecom giants, which don’t see the need for any new regulation at all.\r\n  </p> \r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\n“I think that, in concept, the idea that there should be stronger privacy standards for edge providers and internet service providers is right,” said Neema Singh Guliani, the legislative counsel at the ACLU.</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\nBut Blackburn, she added, should have gone about it differently. “The way to do it was not ... [through] gutting the FCC’s rules; the way to do it was actively working on a replacement.”<sup>3</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The bill is similar to the European data privacy model, <i>E.U. General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)</i>, which serves as point of reference.<sup>2</sup> On May 14,   Europeans will   be implementing a pan-internet--edge and ISP--data protections, which include e-mail, Facebook and other apps, equally as for Comcast and Verizon, and industry-wide privacy defaults; Further, opt-in for privacy is more meaningful separate, and  not relegated to the main Terms and Conditions.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<p>Policy regulation in other industries--exemplified by medical <i>HIPAA</i>, financial <i>Fair Credit   Reporting Act</i>--reveals the noticeable absence of similar policy in Tech. Tech's regulation is however necessarily far more complex, involving at minimum trade-offs between app-to-app data portability and new boundaries for different sources and forms of data. Clearly, the browser-based, high-security HTTPS Encryption I mentioned in my <a href=\"#18-04-06\">April 6 three-part series on Progressive Web Apps </a>will undoubtedly be used for quick, inexpensive data privacy compliance, <i>a real boon for JavaScript developers</i>--as if there wasn't enough work already!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"cite\">2. <a href=\"https://www.eugdpr.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eugdpr.org\r\n</a></p>  \r\n\r\n        <p class=\"cite\">3. <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/5/24/15685870/new-republican-privacy-bill-tech-telecom-lobbying-fcc-congress\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.recode.net/2017/5/24/15685870/new-republican-privacy-bill-tech-telecom-lobbying-fcc-congress\r\n        </a></p>  \r\n    <p class=\"cite\">3. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/technology/a-tough-task-for-facebook-european-type-privacy-for-all.html?ribbon-ad-idx=2&rref=technology&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Technology&pgtype=article\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/technology/a-tough-task-for-facebook-european-type-privacy-for-all.html?ribbon-ad-idx=2&rref=technology&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Technology&pgtype=article\r\n    </a> </p>  \r\n<p class=\"cite\">4. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-zuckerberg/zuckerberg-resists-effort-by-u-s-senators-to-commit-him-to-regulation-idUSKBN1HH1CU\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-zuckerberg/zuckerberg-resists-effort-by-u-s-senators-to-commit-him-to-regulation-idUSKBN1HH1CU\r\n</a></p>  \r\n\r\n</div> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"18-04-10\" class=\"      avr 18-03 -24\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"> <button>Top</button> </a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4> \r\n<h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5> \r\n<p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p> \r\n<h6    class=\"  chapternumber\">April 10, 2018<br /> \r\n</h6> \r\n<h6    class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">When a Pickpocket is Pickpocketed:<br />  Part II:  \"Semantic Polymorphism\", i.e., Double Talk about  Data \r\n</h6> \r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Mark Zuckerberg daftly played word-tennis with   Senators in the first day of Congressional Hearings on Facebook Data Privacy issues. Although, in this case, <i>there were two, at times three, tennis balls at play!</i> What I mean is that \"Data\" and \"Personal Data\" vaccilated in meaning:  At times, Senators' questions referred to, 1.) personally identifiable data with intimate personal details, full name, location data (sensitive-data); 2.) Other times questions referred to <i>derivative data, i.e. data wrangled, refined, merged with different datasets</i> (composite-data); and,  3.) sometimes the questions meant the harmless, identity-encrypted \"ad-data\"(anonymized-data); but, usually, Zuckerberg responded to a question about one of these three meanings of \"personal data\", by responding with a non-abstract fourth: 4.) \"Senator, the data, the 'likes' and pictures you share with Facebook, they are your property,\" Zuckerberg would answer. Well, thank goodness! </p>\r\n<p> My blogpost talks about the shades of meaning: We all know the light-hearted awkwardness when a conversation splits into two separate threads because each party unknowingly follows differing meanings from the same word, or idea.  Austin Powers would have more fun with it, but the Sociologists typically call it  a <i>Semantic Predicament</i>.<sup>1</sup></p> \r\n<p>In fairness, Mark Zuckerberg volunteered as he himself was not subpoenaed, and therefore this preliminary, public discourse was critical for creating shared meaning and language about a complex topic. By volunteering to engage conversation with Senators, Zuckerberg interrupts the <i>game of telephone</i>; and, Senators engage with their constituents, and lo, America saves two years' of misunderstandings for clear data-protection action now. Bravo, Mark! Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the braver CEOs in American history--Now, he has earned his place right next to Andrew Carnegie--and very similar lives, too. And now, with defined boundaries, <i>Tech has a better roadmap</i> for ethical policy and sensible regulation.

These three fields approach research differently. Psychometricians are less causally oriented, as their tool, \"factor analysis\"--<i>analyse factorielle</i>--reduces complex data to dimple, categorical forms in order to reconcile <i>quantitative data</i> with intuitive categories.<sup>1.</sup> And this research is great for expanding knowledge about society. But to what end? Who's to say, after all society is both the subject <i>and</i> object of this research. Social scientists are used to these mental gymnastics, yet are bound by a certain ethos of research: <strong>Anonymization, i.e. encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from datasets</strong>. This is the Social Scientists' <i>Oath</i>--a line of decency. </p>\r\n<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday at noon, the world will tune in to hear Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before the U.S. Congress, all to hear about Facebook &amp; company's line of decency. However indecent any revelations may be, I'm not that entirely threatened by the revelations. Maybe I won't admit I'm   prone to Social Media influence, because I chart my course. Here's more from the esteemed Abbott: </p> \r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">“We have ended up believing that social reality is determined in the main by certain general forces, and that these generalities are then specified by combinations of forces, and further limited by various aspects of “individuality,” which in this sense is best understood as idiosyncratic higher order interaction.”<sup>1</sup> </p>\r\n<p>And so, while academic research focuses on the \"general forces\" to better understand how groups work together, the <strong>bad thing that Zuckerberg did</strong> is not following in the same spirit of generality.<sup>2</sup> They chose to collect and disseminate our \"likes\" as much as our locations, and ... wait for the ominous music ... the <i><strong>non-FB connected mobile contacts of the Facebook clients' personal cell-phones</strong></i>--flipping through someone's personal desk drawer is definitely pushing the rules of privacy. I addressed this issue in my <a href=\"#18-03-20\">March 20th blog post</a> on Facebook's ethics versus the long-standing data-handling ethics from Academia. Regarding tomorrow's revelations, let's remember to give the guy benefit of the doubt, even if they were handily swindled, while they were swindling us.<sup>3</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"cite\">1. <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0049124198027002002\" target=\"_blank\">Abbott, A. 1998. “ The Causal Devolution.” Sociological Methods &amp; Research.\r\n\r\n</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"cite\">2. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/facebook-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/facebook-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica.html\r\n</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"cite\">3. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/did-cambridge-analytica-access-your-facebook-data/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wired.com/story/did-cambridge-analytica-access-your-facebook-data/\r\n</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div> \r\n\r\n<div id=\"18-04-07\" class=\"      avr 18-03 -24\">\r\n<hr />\r\n<a href=\"#top\"> \r\n  <button>Top</button> </a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4> \r\n<h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5> \r\n<p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p> \r\n<h6    class=\"  chapternumber\">April 7-8, 2018<br />\r\nWeekend\r\n</h6> \r\n<h6    class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">\r\nOn the\tInevitable Demise of   Native Mobile Apps in favor of Progressive Web Apps<br />Part III: The Nuts &amp; Bolts of the App Replacement Process</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Revolutions come and revolutions go, but the <i>2nd app revolution</i> is already underway, albeit quietly.<sup>1</sup> Most media sources refer to a \"Native App - Progressive Web App Debate\" with emphasis on what the native app can already do--<i>so if it's not broke, don't fix it</i>. However, implications change as the conversation turns to the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Chrome V-8 JavaScript Engine<sup>2</sup>--you know, the web-app on <i>steroids</i>! </p>\r\n<p>So what kind of steroids you ask? Let us say that the power of the modern browser lies in the open-source JavaScript engine, first C++ variation <i>originally </i>introduced in 2008 by Google's Chromium project. Open-source<i>-who?</i> (close your eyes next paragraph for the jargon-wary!) </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">A JavaScript engine is a program or an interpreter which executes JavaScript code. A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard interpreter, or just-in-time compiler that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>In plain english, this means that the browser speaks directly to machine code, and this is a big deal. Happily 'roided, the browser now accomodates tasks that the \"App\" was invented for: <i>To direct service work</i>--image and data loading, caching, storage, offline data, icons, notifica       tions, etc. </p>\r\n<p>Now, through a \"Manifest\" file provided to the device from the browser, all of those same tasks are accomplished through a series of handshakes, and voil&aacute;: the mobile device doesn't see the difference between a native app and, well ... a <i>progressive app!</i></p>\r\n<p>They say History repeats itself. In our digital lifetime, we have seen <i>record sales</i> surpass digital downloads again (due to streaming); we have seen the originally-decentralized internet return, or at least begin the journey, back to decentralization! And now, we have the once-lowly browser return with a vengeance and strength to replace native apps, with encrypted security, instant loading, and <i>better</i> off-line caching!

This means that the browser achieves instant loading, <i>fully progressive, device-responsive,</i> full <i>HTTPS</i>-encryption security, and coherent cross-browser compatibility. So that your favorite   apps look and interact the same between the array of browser choices. The Washington Post has been lauded for helping pioneer the technology.

For the impatient, this delay is not tolerable, and even the patient have their urgent moments (or have better things to do).    So, whether we're Verizon, T-Mobile, or pre-pay phones like Sprint's Boost, our experiences are the same: 3-second delays abound--much to our impatience!  </p>\r\n<p >Instant Loading </p>\r\n<p >In contrast, many of our daily web-based tasks are instant, i.e. a second or less. I feel instant loading should be <i>a right</i>, not an occasional convenience. what does this potential mean? This means an app's service workers can load nearly immediately and reliably. This means  non-choppy  animations, smooth scrolling, no matter the network connection you're using, no matter the device!  </p>\r\n<p  >Device-Neutral User Interface</p>\r\n\r\n<p  >After a long-day's work using desktop and mobile apps, why should an evening transition to tablet or laptop change our experience? Further, these variations differ between apps--of which there are alot:  2.2 million apps in the iTunes collection and 3 million Android apps, as of 2017<sup>2</sup>. of iOS apps &amp; 3 million. \t My Fitbit experience is illustrative. First, I admit I have a terrible addiction to statistics, especially bio-statistics. And, Fitbit is my enabler.   However, my post-run tablet Fitbit app experience is different and more limited from the HTTPS-browser experience. App features, options, views, date-ranges vary between devices.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p  >Security </p>\r\n<p  >HTTPS-level <i>browser</i> security vs. iTunes &amp; Play Store native app security is akin to a vault door versus building door.

Hedera Hashgraph represents a blockchain alternative that caters to time-sensitive transactions, and order fairness. Currently, one transaction with Bitcoin takes about 12 minutes to validate. Ethereum is only a couple minutes, but in a world of micro-transactions and micro-second transactions, speed counts.</p><p>Next, Hedera's technology uses a consensus algorithm, which depends on  node neighbors' \"voting\" elections. This means that the design is impervious to \"forking\"--when a part of the blockchain splits and no long syncs with the main blockchain.  More importantly, Hedera's consensus design is   built on Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT), so is then impervious to threats of <i>Distributed Denial of Service (DDS) attacks. </i></p>\r\n<p>So, lightning speed for validating crypto-transactions. Guaranteed security from hard- or soft-forking of the blockchain, and DDS-like attacks. Fairness in transaction order. Come May 9th, we'll see just how Hedera's codebase and cryptocurrency will accomplish these benchmarks, and if so, Heraclitean river stops in time!

It <i>did</i> let us, our whole society, let us down, and maybe the forensics will give us <i>a few excuses</i> down on the road. However, \"homicide by A.I.

There are a few software engineers that did the best they could--with the time their superiors gave them.  Uber leadership, let's hope, will be deterred from future carelessnes to come.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>That diatribe said, I do appreciate an Uber's proximity when I'm stranded at 2:00 am in a bad part of town. Why? Because I don't need to plan ahead -- Uber is there! And, sadly, I don't need to read or study -- Google is there! But wait, don't judge me, I'm not lazy! That being said, I have my own soul-searching to do: TECHNOLOGY AIDS AND ABETS ME AND MY ACTIONS, but it does not run my show> Only I take responsibility for my own actions: I allow technology into my life as a tool, and yet I   hold the power cord.

Next, A.I. will make irrelevant fossil fuels by 2030, if not before; and those caught polluting would be fined to death, anyway. Without A.I., none of these worthwhile goals are possible. This precarious, difficult and most of all laborious job of designing our own solutions will take time: For this reason, Uber should be shamed even further for their short-cuts, and eventual errors of internal, organizational problems. <i>Uber's experiemental, tax-free \"Testing Sandbox\" cannot be the erstwhile safe neighborhoods of Surburban Phoenix, without proper caution.</i> </p>\t\t\r\n<p>Are Uber's corporate desires, market stronghold, and shareholders' delight more worthwhile than <i>an entire sensitive field of machine-learning research?</i> No. Uber must be warned to not steal corporate secrets from Waymo, then proceed to be 86'd from California, then brush aside with excuses the <i>killing of an innocent Arizona bicyclist</i>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWho can count the number of very feisty taxi-men and -women that are not fans of the infamously hasty culture of Uber.

Although we could all debate the merits of \"Lidar\", i.e. laser-based vision, the primary concern, in my view, is Uber's obvious carelessness in rushing their self-driving tech.  Although six thousand (6,000 too many) pedestrians are killed in the U.S. annually, I'd only hope AI wouldn't add to the problem.<sup>2</sup> The Arizona victim was walking her bicycle when struck, and I as bike-commuter can't help but take the affair personally. </p>\r\n<p>This first human death is at least a <strong>big Wake-Up moment</strong> for the industry in its haste to roll out A.I. tech.  After all, Uber's questionable leadership morals<sup>2</sup> and being kicked out of San Francisco for running more than six red-lights raises eyebrows to begin with.<sup>3</sup> My problem with Uber is that the car's algorithm, with perfect Lidar vision, did not flinch or slow down for two seconds as it killed the victim. Humans flinch and humans swerve, because protecting fellow humans is in our DNA, not in A.I.'s. So, while we now know Uber's software hasn't caught up with its A.I.-Lidar hardware--let's hope we see defensive driving and some <i>TLC</i> programmed into those A.I.

This is because data and data research\r\nis innate to the university's Mission Statement, whereas business and governmental institutions are relatively new\r\nto the game, and often at odds with the\r\n<i>Academy</i>, and occasionally against each other. </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Threats to student data privacy existed long before the internet. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover infiltrated Berkeley\r\nstudent groups to counter communism in the 1960s. Around the same time, the CIA manipulated the National Student\r\nAssociation for intelligence gathering in other anti-communism efforts. But the privacy issue is more acute now\r\nthat the amount of student data in cloud-based systems has grown exponentially and is more widely dispersed.\r\n<sup>2</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p> The University's expertise over ethically regulated data collection and management, is better than government, business,\r\nand even medical domains for two reasons. First, the institution's long history and ethical motives with data are\r\nunique. The norms of data-handling have been codified through the University's Institutional Review Board based\r\non its\r\n<strong>stated mission</strong>. In other words, Universities take data seriously\r\n<i>for reasons other than corporate profit or governmental control</i>. An example of personal data precautions has\r\nplayed out with Harvard's recent data tiffs leading to the Supreme Court, illustrated by a 2016 article: </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Last week undergraduates at Harvard University raised concerns about the institution handing over their data to an\r\nanti-affirmative action group as part of a lawsuit. Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing the university\r\nfor allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants, will have access to “academic, extracurricular,\r\ndemographic and other information” from all undergrads who applied to Harvard between the fall 2009 and spring 2015,\r\nomitting names and Social Security numbers.\r\n<sup>2</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The second reason why Universities understand ethical implications for data is that data and more broadly data and\r\nhuman information\r\n<i>research</i> is the institutions' second highest priority, along with teaching and service. For example, in response\r\nto the unethical Public Health research in\r\n<i>Tuskegee Syphilis experiements</i>, the University instution\r\n<i>stepped in</i> to help design the 1978\r\n<strong>Belmont Principles</strong>. Currently, the University Institutional Review Board incorporates this with the Nuremburg\r\nCode (developed after WWII NAZI research), in handling data research.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In recent days,\r\n<i>private companies</i> claim expertise for regulating \"Fake News\", and you guessed it,\r\n<strong>regulation of data privacy &amp; confidentiality.</strong><sup>3</sup> The ethical authority over data privacy norms are nowhere\r\nelse than the University campus, case in point Harvard... Let the governments govern and the enterprises enterprise,\r\nand leave the\r\n<i>thoughtful, ethical regulation of data collection and precaution </i> to the Ivory Tower. Corporate and Government\r\nself-regulation is opaque enough!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"cite\">1.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/21/mark-zuckerberg-response-facebook-cambridge-analytica\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/21/mark-zuckerberg-response-facebook-cambridge-analytica</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"cite\">2.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-10-26-pursuing-academic-freedom-and-data-privacy-is-a-balancing-act\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-10-26-pursuing-academic-freedom-and-data-privacy-is-a-balancing-act</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"cite\">3.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/paul-ford-facebook-is-why-we-need-a-digital-protection-agency\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/paul-ford-facebook-is-why-we-need-a-digital-protection-agency</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"18-03-19\" class=\"  mar 18-03 -19\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"  chapternumber\">March 19, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">A New Politics of Power:\r\n<br /> The Cryptographic Financial Escape Hatch\r\n</h6>\r\n<p>I had originally intended for a post on the very lamentable\r\n<i>Blockbuster-ization</i> and eventual demise of Toys-\"R\"-Us, but Tech Affairs happen too quickly!

Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country\r\nhad begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation’s vast petroleum reserves.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation\r\nof the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation.\r\n<sup>1</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis turn of events, both Maduro et al.'s financial cleverness and Trump's action to de-legitimate the Petro crypto-currency,\r\nare examples of the undefined, near-limitless political uses for Blockchain Tech, both offensively and defensively.\r\nIn fact, the ensuing events may be of great interest as we will witness a major first actual use-case of the decentralizing\r\naims of crypto-technology tool. A tool that softens the financial leverage wielded by centralized authorities, whether\r\ngovernemntal or private.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I used the term \"de-legitimate\" above because there are two processes at work: First, crypto-currencies are\r\n<i>in themselves</i> not legitimate. A\r\n<strong>crypto-currency platform gains legitimacy through a series of both technical and financial trust-building stages</strong>.\r\nSo legitimacy is earned first privately, and some currency platforms continue publicly to Initial Coin Offering,\r\nand so on--purely financial and technical legitimacy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>And then, there is the another kind of legitimacy, which involves political leverage ... </p>\r\n<p class=\"cite\">1.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/world/americas/trump-venezuela-sanctions-petro.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/world/americas/trump-venezuela-sanctions-petro.html</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"18-03-17\" class=\"  mar 18-03 -17\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"  chapternumber\">March 17-18 2018\r\n<br /> Weekend\r\n</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come, Part II: A Ripple and an Iota of Sustainable Crypto-Currency\r\n</h6>\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Iota and Ripple cryptocurrencies use different technology than traditional blockchain in order to achieve their distributed\r\nledgers. Traditionally, outside \"miners\" validate the block's\r\n<i> transaction records</i> as it replicates to the next \"block.\" For example, a transaction is validated 2 or three\r\ntimes, and since three miners' validations all agree, one is kept and two are destroyed, in a nutshell; one example\r\nof computations (\r\n<strong>and hence coal</strong>) that cost too much time and energy.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike this arrangement, Iota, Ripple, and Hedera use a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) data structure (shaped like\r\na sideways genealogy tree) that relies on \"consensus\" from its nearest neighbor transaction nodes.\r\n<sup>1</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Enough with the jargon! The bottom line is that Bitcoin's tech is not eco-sustainable,\r\n<sup>2</sup> and so alternatives are already closing in on Bitcoin. Iota, the 8th largest cryptocurrency Iota delivers\r\nopen-source transparency, lightning speed, and yet is it cryptographically sound? Not according to some tech pundits:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">You might think that IOTA, a cryptocurrency worth over a billion dollars, and working with organizations like Microsoft,\r\nUniversity College London, Innogy, and Bosch, BNY Mellon, Cisco, and Foxconn (through the Trusted IOT Alliance)\r\nwould not have fairly obvious vulnerabilities, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. When we took a look at their\r\nsystem, we found a serious vulnerability and textbook insecure code.\r\n<br />\r\n<br /> “In 2017, leaving your crypto algorithm vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis is a rookie mistake. It says that\r\nno one of any calibre analyzed their system, and that the odds that their fix makes the system secure is low,” states\r\nBruce Schneier, renowned security technologist, about IOTA when we shared our attack.\r\n<sup>3</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>And so, with a 1.9 billion market cap, I sometimes have to reflect on the immensity and non-relational fact and figures\r\nof our technological world! Security and other bugs are hard to avoid when an industry is moving too fast for thoroughly\r\ntested betas; and each iteration involves a series of bug-patches, with short- and long-term priorities stretched\r\nwith new design &amp; function trade-offs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFull life-cycle software development, from napkin-idea to rolling specs, always follows these patterns yet not always with\r\nso much money on the line! Here's a closer look at one critique of Iota:</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\nIOTA developers had written their own hash function, it was a huge red flag ... I think it’s important to reiterate that\r\nthe IOTA developers do not agree with our characterization of this as an issue of concern. Our report lays out more\r\ndetails about why we are concerned.\r\n<br />\r\n<br /> There are other red flags — unlike every other program running on your laptop or phone, IOTA uses ternary instead\r\nof binary. Since all computer hardware today uses binary, IOTA converts to ternary in software, which is less efficient\r\nand more complex. This complexity prevents IOTA from benefiting from existing security analysis tools that are designed\r\nto work with binary, and makes the code harder to read and understand.\r\n<br />\r\n<br /> The current IOTA tangle requires a trusted party (the coordinator) for security, suggesting that in its current\r\nform it’s not ready to run as a truly permissionless, decentralized system.\r\n<sup>3</sup>\r\n</p><p>\r\nOptimizing, not sacrificing, should be the name of the game as Tech closes in on Blockchain challenges of security, scalability,\r\nand that evers-so-costly\r\n<strong>Sustainability!</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/next-generation-crypto-ledgers-take-the-block-out-of-blockchain\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/next-generation-crypto-ledgers-take-the-block-out-of-blockchain</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"\r\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>3.\r\n<a href=\"\r\nhttps://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"18-03-16\" class=\"  mar 18-03 -17\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"  chapternumber\">March 16, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come\r\n</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Sustainability for the environment means an accelerated transition to renewables.

Well, besides less fossil fuels and red meat, we\r\ncan choose our cryptocurrencies more conscientiously.

For 18 months, the 20,000-resident\r\ncity will not consider new applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining.

All creative fields also have technological features on the horizon that\r\nmay, potentially move the playing field. First some recent background: </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\nWhile [Taylor Swift] is certainly making money in retail sales and digital downloads, both of those metrics are spiraling\r\ndownward as people migrate away from the concept of owning music at all. Nielsen recently released numbers indicating\r\nsubstantial drops in both CD and digital-track sales, which are down almost $100 million\r\n<i>year over year</i> from 2014; streaming music continues to grow, but the revenue it generates isn’t close to making\r\nup the difference, yet.\r\n<sup>1</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Most remember Taylor Swift's 2014 industry-shaking album withdraw in protest to Spotify's payment structure. The\r\nnext year Taylor took on Apple iTunes--to which Apple bended to Taylor's Way\r\n<sup>2</sup>. These wins are amazing but not enough, if only for winning battles in a losing war. </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Spotify is the future. Spotify is the enemy. Spotify doesn’t pay enough. Spotify is music’s best bet for revenue\r\ngrowth. Since it arrived in the United States from Sweden in 2011, Spotify has been cast as both hero and villain\r\nin the music industry’s continuing debate over streaming music. </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\nIt has been hailed as a potential savior through a two-tiered “freemium” model that would gradually lure listeners away from\r\npiracy. Yet Spotify’s royalty rates have also terrified many artists already worried that each new step in music’s\r\ndigital evolution further devalues their work.\r\n<sup>3</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>So the trend looks dire, and yet is it really? Where, just where are the\r\n<strong>Tech Platforms </strong> leading us? Tech is leading us\r\n<i>nowhere</i>, at least not to one\r\n<strong>singular, centralized place</strong>; rather, decentralized tech--including but not limited to blockchain--is busy\r\nrewriting the boundaries between creators and consumers. This Tuesday's Forbes article reported on new subscription-based\r\nmodel by Patreon. Still classical Web 2.0, it's novelty appears so simple, almost intuitive in potentially new pathway:</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\"On Kickstarter and Indiegogo, creators essentially have to start over every time,\" says Danny Rimer, a partner at\r\nIndex Ventures who is a Patreon investor and board member. \"It's the same reason software companies went from licensed\r\nsoftware to subscriptions: predictable revenue and better service for customers.\"\r\n<sup>4</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nApparently Patreon, along with last November's\r\n<i>Drip</i> by KickStarter have made headway.

Yet, the message more powerfully articulated than ever by adolescent-turns-adult\r\nstudents, takes aim at something further afield. </p>\r\n<p>Students, remembering the February 14th massacre victims, take aim at the corruption stemming from the 2010 Supreme\r\nCourt \"Person-hood\" protection for Corporations, also known as the\r\n<i>Citizens United</i> Decision. A dated, but poignant, article from National Public Radio explains:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">The Supreme Court extended that protection to corporations, and over time also extended some — but not all — of the\r\nrights guaranteed to individuals in the Bill of Rights.\r\n<sup>1</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet, it appears deceptively harmless for Congressional Law-makers to protect corporations, in the form of\r\n<strong>Gun Manufacturers' Lobbyists, </strong>\r\nas equally as it protects humans. The origin or this ruling dates to a 70's Neo-Liberal, right-leaning legislation and Court\r\nrulings that include a pivotal 1978\r\n<i>First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti</i> decision allowing for corporations' ballot-initiative campaign contributions,\r\nciting the First Amendment.\r\n<sup>2</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe Result? The corporation, in \"person\" form, takes on Pseudo-Human qualities: immortal, beyond-measure capital, and programmatically\r\nserving stock-holders' interests with cut-throat competition at all costs. No match against a sympathetic human,\r\nyet the Corporation is given the same rights and privileges as the man in the street. Now, in the face of two decades'\r\ndead humans--as young as\r\n<i>Sandy Hook Elementary</i>, which were not protected by Legislation, due to commitments made to corporate lobbying.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>It appears increasingly difficult for Marco Rubio to accept money from gun lobbyists\r\n<i>in exchange</i> for executing their legislation demands.

This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint.\r\nFor example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore's 49.8!</p>\r\n<p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to\r\n<i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking:\r\nDenial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot),\r\nso the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle. </p>\r\n<p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly,\r\nthis is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950's (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating\r\nsystem. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nNext, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of \"fairness\" because blockchain transactions are\r\n<i>\r\n<strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i> Bitcoin transactions are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle,\r\nwhich is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p>\r\n<p>\r\nSwirld's unveiled their consensus-based\r\n<strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has now been announced to\r\ndeploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news! Tremendous, since I explained\r\nin my\r\n<a href=\"#18-03-01\">March 1st </a> blog post that older blockchain technologies incentivize miners' efforts by directly tying electrical-cost(\r\n(in calculations) to the Bitcoin/hour profit margin. For this reason, the future horizon just considerably shortened\r\nBitcoin's runway for establishing anything beyond \"early-adopter\" status. </p>\r\n<p>So, we'll see if the innovating crew with Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum can successfully alter the crypto algorithm\r\ninto it's planned carbon-free consensus-based, \"proof-of-stake\" form. For the moment, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other\r\nelectricity-draining \"proof-of-work\" designs, have their\r\n<strong>exchange value trapped inside their own Carbon Footprint</strong>.\r\n<sup>4</sup> And so, because environmental sustainablity is foremost of concerns for future investment, survival may\r\ndepend on digging out of that Carbon Footprint much more quickly!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-thinks-it-can-one-up-bitcoin-and-ethereum-with-faster-transactions/#175e5c79abcb\">\r\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-thinks-it-can-one-up-bitcoin-and-ethereum-with-faster-transactions/#175e5c79abcb\r\n</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/hedera-hashgraph-swirlds-no-fork-guarantee-cryptocurrency-touts-resistance-code-splits/\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">\r\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/hedera-hashgraph-swirlds-no-fork-guarantee-cryptocurrency-touts-resistance-code-splits/</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.\r\n<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-and-mz-unveil-next-generation-blockchain-alternative/\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">\r\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-and-mz-unveil-next-generation-blockchain-alternative/</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>4.\r\n<a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"mar 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-03-12\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">March 12, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:\r\n<br /> Part II and New Forms of Trust</h6>\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">\r\nThroughout the centralized-tech period of the\r\n<i>mobile-powered </i> Web 2.0, most Sharing transactions take place on a centralized platform that simply facilitates\r\nthe peer-to-peer transactions. However, the trust is based on some third-party authority. For instance, Uber serves\r\nas the centralalized, third-party authority between both consumers (whether resource-obtaining or resource-providing)\r\nmust place their trust. Similarly, centralized authorities like Paypal, etc. enable peer-to-peer collaboration.\r\nYet, the notion of trust remains unsolved: Both parties must place their faith in the third party. By definition,\r\nthis problem that undermines the\r\n<i>Sharing Economy</i> is resolved by Blockchain technologies, through cryptography. Now, Decentralized Apps (DAPPS)\r\nprovide a truer sharing platform for value transactions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In short, neither peer,\r\n<strong>neither consumer needs to be trusted, because both parties share a mutual trust in their shared ledger</strong>\r\n(think of a thick book with an indexed log of each and every transaction, with unchangeable entries etched by cryptography.\r\nIn this fashion the forms of Exchange Value include:\r\n<br /> 1. Value Funds &amp; Investments\r\n<br /> 2. Immutable Insurance &amp; Risk Management\r\n<br /> 3. Account for &amp; Audit Commodified Value 4. Authenticate &amp; Attest to Value\r\n<br /> 5.

Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer\r\nmarketplaces,\r\n<i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer\r\nof resources. By either sense, the\r\n<i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media,\r\ninternet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s\r\n<i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods\r\nand services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In\r\n<i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how\r\nthe\r\n<strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>.\r\n<sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3) breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general\r\npurpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power,\r\nsources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first condition: New forms of communication to\r\n<i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second\r\ncondition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition:\r\nNew methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving\r\nsolar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated,\r\ndriverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new\r\ntechnology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s\r\ninnovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in\r\nthe present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively\r\nthe New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how can we change the way we\r\n<i>think</i> and how we\r\n<i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on\r\n<strong>\r\n<i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i>\r\n</strong>\r\n<sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will\r\na New Paradigm Shift emerge. In this occasion however, we as a society may not have the luxury of decades to adapt\r\nto New Technologies, as the carbon hangover from the previous Industrial Era imperils the safe arrival of the next!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/node/21553017\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.economist.com/node/21553017</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.\r\n<a href=\"https://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">3.

This means that every institution, whether private hospitals, non-profit charity\r\nfoundations, or government bureaus, will effectively restructure (optimize) their own organizational structure in\r\nan increasingly\r\n<i>data-driven</i> paradigm. From a Sociology of Organizations perspective, the changes to come are breath-taking to\r\nconsider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why women? Where could I start? Better stated, why is a quintessentially important job sector, a sector in desperate\r\nneed for insight, comprised primarily of men?\r\n<sup id=\"one\">1</sup> The facts are evident: ~15-20% of women comprising tech positions.\r\n<sup id=\"two\">2</sup> Numbers aside, I argue there is a quintessential societal need for more women in tech: This is because computing\r\nand understanding data has changed since the data collection from Web 2.0 (mobile), becoming more networked and\r\nrelational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge for society in this age is historic, and women must absolutely be included in the process of the age:\r\nPlease consider, that in the 1650&#39;s, the invention of the microscope opened a new world of data and\r\n<i>information</i> about the bacteriological, microscopic surroundings--hitherto blind to all. Likewise, the telescope\r\nhas allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage)\r\na universe of knowledge--about\r\n<i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the\r\ndata to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the\r\n<i>output</i> can be\r\n<i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the\r\nkey challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables. This is akin\r\nto finding a needle in an increasingly complex and growing haystack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">What&#39;s different now and has changed is it&#39;s no longer about taking this data, putting it into a computer\r\nrunning a calculation and getting a balance sheet answer ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">What&#39;s important now is what is the context of the data, what is it connected to, what effect is it having on\r\ndata around it... It&#39;s basically a network of the data, it&#39;s no longer sort of tabular columns, of rows\r\nof data, it&#39;s\r\n<i>interconnected patterns</i>.\r\n<br /> --Tim Cook</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This quote means that as we move away from rule-based, mechanistic data analytics toward more complex, relational\r\nand networked data, we need an equally complex paradigm to keep up.

Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era\r\n<sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any\r\nmedical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39;\r\nsurface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively,\r\nand provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics\r\nare\r\n<i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating\r\nstrains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies\r\nrelied on a misleading methodology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations\r\nin the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which\r\nmanufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while\r\nit is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains.\r\n<sup>1</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu\r\nvirus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu\r\n<i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with\r\n<i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses\r\nthat happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that\r\nare pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic\r\ntree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system\r\nexposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond\r\n<sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular\r\nperiod each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal\r\ntime-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further\r\naway on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses.\r\n<sup>2</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a\r\n<i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also\r\nprovides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain\r\nmath can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort\r\nof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each\r\nother, then conditional upon other factors. This being\r\n<i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e\r\nthings: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any\r\n<i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions\r\nabout a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our\r\nsciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The\r\nfirst of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of\r\nwhich gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating\r\n<i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better\r\nhandle on the multiple effects of\r\n<sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large\r\nNumbers\r\n<sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new\r\n<strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the\r\n<i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician\r\nout there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail </a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual\" target=\"_blank\"> https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual </a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm </a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"mar 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-03-03\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">March 3-4, 2018\r\n<br /> Weekend\r\n</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Back in 1997, a Pulitzer-Prize winning theory--based on Dr. Jared Diamond&#39;s\r\n<i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies</i> --provided the recipe book for the success of societies.\r\nNot without controversy, the theory posits that geographic and environmental preconditions, once met, provide tech\r\n&amp; resources trading opportunities, within a network of other nation-states also vying for technogical innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A nation&#39;s Technology, in turn, opens the means necessary to expansive, stable, independent sovereignty that\r\nlasts and thrives.

This problem, experienced by\r\nthe top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the\r\n<i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the\r\n<i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity KiloWatt Hours\r\nper year.\r\n<sup>1</sup> Digiconomist succinctly writes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a\r\nsolid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years\r\nthis has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of\r\nthe currency reached new highs.\r\n<sup>2</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, so the issue I&#39;m addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more\r\nequipment, and in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin&#39;s surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year\r\nusage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per year, respectively.\r\nIn other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner&#39;s cost (in electricity) compared with the miner&#39;s gain (in\r\nBitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper Carbon Footprint.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin network has\r\nbeen increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start of November 2017, the Bitcoin\r\nEnergy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network to be half of the\r\ncurrent amount. On the first day of November, the estimated consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year.\r\n<sup>1</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCarbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner&#39;s electricity costs account for approximately\r\n65% of the profit (Bitcoin units&#39; value, measured when mined). So the\r\n<i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost\r\nof the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the\r\n<i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then\r\nperhaps the other edge looks preferred!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"\r\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"\r\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption </a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<button id=\"febtop\">TOP \r\nFEBRUARY \r\n<br />\r\n<h4>POSTS FEBRUARY 2018</h4>\r\n<br />\r\n<h6>First Blog Post!</h6>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-10\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 10, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6>First Blog Post!</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Why are Sociologists now the Key Players in Data Analysis within the Domain of Blockchain Technologies?</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin and other\r\ncryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology (peer-to-peer global\r\nip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate, individual needs and uses.\r\nThese blockchain &quot;network&quot; analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network changes, node\r\nchanges, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships) that\r\ninclude arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain tech must face analytical\r\nchallenges that arise from informal practices\r\n<sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role&#39;s protocol for\r\nthe sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan&#39;s (1977)\r\n<i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple\r\n<i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time, convenience,\r\netc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm human understanding\r\n<i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of a bank, a person,\r\nor a company&#39;s internal bot?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought the\r\nworld the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can only contribute little on how to interface with social\r\nneeds. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the multi-dimensional layers\r\nof hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks? Well enough to differentiate qualitative\r\nmeaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved, integrated\r\nthrough multiple layers of &quot;middlemen&quot;, such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions, non-governmental,\r\nnon-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases the middlemen. Suddenly, one\r\nprogrammer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team\r\nof hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the life of\r\nthe contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years&#39; Sociology Network Analysts&#39;\r\nresearch and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and should not turn to the\r\nHard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already at home, safe within the academic\r\ndomain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology\r\ncan either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances, accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises.\r\nOr, the next ten years can follow Sociology&#39;s Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful\r\nfuture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on\r\nreview of the Sociologists&#39; specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships,\r\nwithin social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships.\r\nWe Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized\r\nby fixed patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes that characterize\r\nsocietal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large Number Statistical Theory\r\nbecome consumated with the brilliance of early 1900&#39;s Sociological French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach&#39;s\r\nwork on the clearly defined network patterns of a society&#39;s Collective Memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic&#39;s &quot;irrational\r\nbehaviors&quot; and Mathematical &quot;complexity models&quot; do not\r\n<i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate simultaneous\r\nnode changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups\r\nget jobs), and most importantly the\r\n<i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time and fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fine. So, why is Sociology&#39;s network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th and\r\n20th centuries&#39; network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era, while North\r\nAmerican Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960&#39;s [post-1968], U.S. in the 1990&#39;s[post-1999],\r\nin the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of past sociology are inherently small-data and\r\nmore qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates &quot;human-ness&quot; into the billion rows and\r\ncolumns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation\r\nfor Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of each relationship\r\n(link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is\r\npossible to isolate directional, conditional\r\n<i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation\r\n<sup id=\"9one\">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on social networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person\r\n<i>self-selects </i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group&#39;s\r\nbehavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group&#39;s behavior,\r\nby the group&#39;s influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder&#39;s SIENA software, achieves\r\nthe impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology. The network graph\r\ncan be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not\r\nas personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes\r\n(social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount\r\nof missing data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear, directed\r\npath of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists are called upon,\r\nblockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again the same bugs. Sadly, this\r\nsemi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain for their currency, contract,\r\nand other societal needs--in this case, the blind will indeed lead the blind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footnotes\">1.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/226550\" id=\"9one\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/226550</a>\r\n<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n2.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/\" id=\"9one\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-11\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 11, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">How Can We Best Modularize our App Designs in Order to Achieve the Much Vaunted &quot;Separation of Concerns&quot;?</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed Order of\r\nCoders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from structural design.\r\nHence, in the early 2000&#39;s, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to abide by The scaffolding\r\nof HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we must throw out this antiquated division\r\nof labor within web coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules and components\r\nMust hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled html, js, css, it is now requisite\r\nto divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and\r\n<i>\r\neach</i> of these component teams\r\n<strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module&#39;s required html, js, css.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and\r\nall coding will necessarily begin to &#39;reinvent the wheel.&#39; This is because any module, any library you go\r\nto, will\r\n<i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate new\r\ncss from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual misery, almost\r\ninstantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher level of abstraction,\r\nleaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice in the modern world, and if\r\nad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity? If yesterday&#39;s craft was the\r\nhoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part\r\nby part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and\r\npastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module\r\ndefinition? That&#39;s absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an age that\r\neach year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic sugar and also fundamental\r\nstructure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us\r\nto a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the &quot;Separation of Concerns.&quot; We can allow ourselves\r\na break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must\r\n<i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-12\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 12, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s Innocence</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Facebook Scandals\r\n<sup>1</sup> of recent months have demoralized the leadership for a role of misinformation in the Tech Age, however I\r\ncharge Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s innocence\r\n<i>not</i> because all of us, as a society, were equally warned. Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created abnormal,\r\nnever-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were so efficient at multiplying\r\nand exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social\r\nlearning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial\r\n<sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation were\r\nnot entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural changes from\r\nhigher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in their content and influence)\r\nbegin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes\r\ndominated by the relationships, e.g., the &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;shares&quot;, leading to a statistically natural\r\npropensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel\r\nto the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal\r\nand tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary\r\n<i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual &quot;interruptions&quot; that\r\npreviously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication that the\r\ntimespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation Bias, misinformation\r\nand outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that are already hard to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,\r\n<i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network phenomonenon--ultimately\r\ndriven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry, conditional influences, and\r\nthe strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these factors, our social inclinations were\r\n<i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network phenomena\r\n-- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footnotes\">1.

So, thoughts\r\nand sympathy for those students today that endured this horror. 19 years after the first-of-its-kind school shooting,\r\nwe as an American society have not become &#39;numb&#39; to these events.

In my blog post from January 10, I wrote that American Sociology, along with Qu&eacute;bec, came of\r\nage much later than European Sociology. The past 50 years&#39; social changes and new problems are generally atrributed\r\nfor the increasing demand for sociological expertise after 1999, after a singular, senseless tragedy of a school\r\nshooting--this event, like a small kernel of societal desperation for a solution--led to a flurry of self-professed\r\nsociologists &agrave; la Michael Moore&#39;s Colombine, and other social-responsibility themed social consciousness.\r\nSo far, only mutually incompatible solutions. The problem, however, is not new, only the manifestation of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suicide rates in 19th century France, disproportionately high, also served as a symptomatic manifestation of the\r\nsame problem, called\r\n<i>Anomie.</i>\r\n<sup>1</sup> The term,\r\n<i>Anomie</i>, coined by Emile Durkheim in the late 1800&#39;s, captured the sense of instability, cultural and moral\r\nrelativism that undermined a shared sense of meaning. Suicides, week-after-week, month-after-month? In 1897 France,\r\nnoone had ever seen it before--at such rates--and people wanted answers. Alas, a kernel of social desperation leading\r\nto inquiry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People wanted to know why so many in the population responded negatively to the rapid changes, urbanization (Dreadful\r\nfactory conditions &agrave; la\r\n<i>Taylorism&#39;s</i> calculated efficiency) new technologies, i.e. electricity, railroads, steam engines; these created\r\nan arbitrarily new world, very suddenly.

Sure, it&#39;s more\r\nof a &quot;metropolitan&quot; phenomenon; and sure, it&#39;s become an accepted global platform--along with myriad\r\nother crypto-currencies, but it&#39;s exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies\r\nare useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency&#39;s rise to\r\nfame with last year&#39;s increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its contributions,\r\nuses, fame are one-sidedly\r\n<i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article\r\n<sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of\r\n<i>actual</i> use at the &quot;cash-registers&quot; of society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological\r\n<i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Rogers&#39;\r\n<i>Diffusion of Innovations</i>\r\n<sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger&#39;s bell curve\r\nranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However, the blockchain\r\narticles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine usefulness for the\r\nevery-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is\r\n<i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific information--whether\r\nfinancial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order before I continue, since we can\r\nall relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most notably concerning Target store credit card\r\nhacks a couple years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions,\r\nthis person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction:\r\nthey prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that $27, $200,\r\nor $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their\r\n<i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and if the store&#39;s\r\ndatabases are hacked, then tough-luck!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for each transaction,\r\nproviding the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient! Nobody thinks to walk around\r\nwith their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit\r\ncard system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions\r\nhave had to rely on the many layers of security, passwords, pins, mothers&#39; maiden names, etc. Then, based on\r\nthe mathematics behind prime numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright\r\nred target on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And that, my\r\nfriends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency, instead\r\nthe crypto-\r\n<i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero&#39;s name\r\nis the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide pinpointed,\r\n<i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for the sake of\r\nrenting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don&#39;t need this. They need\r\nto know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire governmental database of information\r\nabout you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-big-in-investing-but-still-lousy-for-buying-a-sandwich/\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-big-in-investing-but-still-lousy-for-buying-a-sandwich/</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED065999\" target=\"_blank\">Rogers, E.

Who do we think programmers are, sociologists?\r\nMore specifically, who could know\r\n<i>which</i> mundane coding practices, arbitrary app-design--like sharing permissions/features? Sure, everyone deep\r\ndown knew their company practices yield unfathomable power of influence over the daily habits of cell-users, a.k.a.\r\neveryone. The easy part is knowing; the hard part is learning how and why certain app-features lead to behavioral\r\nrisks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There could be no better example than the Alcoholic faced with an intervention by a loving family longing for change.\r\nThe alcoholic could be forgiven for past misdeeds, but without actual\r\n<i>Acknowledgement</i> of a crisis in direction, which necessitates professional help from social scientists. Therefore,\r\nthe recent\r\n<i>acknowledgments</i> signify something deeper--they signify a humility that app-designers are not sociologists, generally\r\nspeaking. So, that means hiring sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists for every N\r\n<small>th</small> app-coder and software engineer. History can&#39;t be rewritten, but it can be interpreted and learned\r\nfrom. The acknowledgment is itself a victory if it induces learning from the raw, social sciences, whose expertise\r\n<i>can</i> predict how or why certain &quot;life&quot;-features, practices, and policies often unfold with undue and\r\nunintended social consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water under the bridge, but going forward, it is one thing to claim a &quot;renewed sense of remorse&quot;, another\r\nto acknowledge, learn and change. Like last November\r\n<sup>1</sup> when Facebook co-founder Sean Parker confessed certain designs like &quot;social-validation feedback loop&quot;\r\nand other app-design intentions, while ignoring potential secondary effects on society.

In my February 15th\r\n<a href=\"#18-02-15\">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects of the\r\ncrypto-contract horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Prologue</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the\r\n<i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals? First, a\r\nlittle background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum blockchain helps distinguish\r\nitself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech, like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based\r\nblockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming features, e.g. &quot;looping&quot;, &quot;recursion&quot;,\r\nwith the full power of a\r\n<i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the accounting\r\nsystem of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction, An Ethereum\r\nblockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,\r\n<i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks to calculate\r\ninto a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, Ethereum&#39;s Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum\r\nblockchain is actually a &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, like a a big networked &quot;home computer&quot;. The native\r\nlanguage of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an\r\n<i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home computer,\r\nthen directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman&#39;s terms, the manner that modern-day app,\r\nfor example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one programming system\r\nto interact with another, such as Instragram offers a &quot;sharing API&quot; that connects to hardware contacts,\r\nthus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook\r\naccount, via your T-Mobile phone&#39;s contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we\r\nlive in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system,\r\nwhich exchanges API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity\r\ndays; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise. The reason\r\nbeing that digital math uses binary &quot;on/off&quot; calculations, while quantum math implicates a tertiary,\r\n<i>qubit</i> &quot;simultaneous states&quot;. Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology,\r\nboth programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA&#39;s blockchain\r\ndesign utilizes a\r\n<i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one&#39;s transaction is entered into with a private-key, and the blockchain\r\nmoreso resembles a &quot;Tangle&quot; of a directed graph, which allows for computational &quot;states&quot;. IOTA\r\nrecently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent vulnerability.\r\nIn truth, this was a case of user-error because users were\r\n<i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer could\r\ncrack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough now to cause\r\ndamage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Social\r\nuseablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun to emerge, at least in form,\r\nwith little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd generation Patrician directed graph blockchain.\r\nThe underlying principle of the blockchain&#39;s micro-economic utiliity through crypto-\r\n<i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions for Supply\r\n&amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of the Hard Sciences of\r\nMathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-19\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech\">OUR DAILY TECH</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 19, 20189</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Blockchains, Bitcoins and The Unnecessary Risk of Shopping at Target with a Credit Card, Part III:\r\n<br />\r\n<br /> Seven Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy\r\n<br />\r\n<small class=\"jargon\">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! The first 3 of 7 new possibilities thanks to the programmable\r\nblockchain.</small>\r\n</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">The guiding light through the centuries of scientific paradigms, in the Kuhnian sense\r\n<sup id=\"19-1\">1</sup>, have derived from deductive ideas from above - whether priestly or royal decree. Then, the primacy of the\r\n<i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then other Paradigm\r\nShifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment authors of 17th, 18th\r\ncentury. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era&#39;s emerging paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority\r\nand responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment.\r\n<i>Historical Materialism</i>\r\n<sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from governmental,\r\nfinancial sources, but rather the\r\n<i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the revolutionary\r\nshift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable data-sharing. Cryptography\r\nhas in a sense become a\r\n<i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong>\r\n<br /> Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical proof, rather\r\nthan exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern period also has held this\r\ndecentralized, individual authority as the\r\n<i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions of humankind,\r\nnot idealogies. In fact, it was the\r\n<i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western Philosophy,\r\nby laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical &quot;ground&quot; upward. This &quot;upside-down\r\ntree&quot; defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of\r\n<i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism, as argued\r\nin Sartre&#39;s\r\n<i>Search for a Method</i>.\r\n<sup>3</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations since Hegel.\r\nI&#39;m so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels. First, cryptography\r\nresemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern social rule (Some once thought\r\nnuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown. Secondly, I&#39;m still dumbfounded that\r\na Paradigm Shift\r\n<i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for a society that\r\nis provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon thousands of\r\nopen-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum Virtual Machine, whose\r\naims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for removing the &quot;middle-person&quot;\r\nfrom the day-to-day, micro-economic &quot;cost of living&quot;. This goes for for the exchanging of titles, legal\r\ndocuments, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing necessity in allocating\r\nincreasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of\r\n<i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms on the near\r\nhorizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on\r\n<i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient by means of\r\nblockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>III. Removing Double-Dipping from International Remittances </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>&quot;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&quot;\r\n</i>\r\n<br /> --Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, 1939</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute;\r\nla Western Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. The existing remittance system (not speaking\r\nto\r\n<i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian friend&#39;s\r\nCanadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national payments systems,\r\nthus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut. Like everything else--c&#39;est la vie. Or is it?\r\nThe beauty of Ethereum is that it &quot;talks&quot; well with others and across borders, while Bitcoin remains of\r\nlittle use for micro-transactions that involve semi-basic calculations. The reason being that Bitcoin blockchain\r\nlanguage, Script, cannot support loops (while statements, etc.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, both EOS and Ethereum blockchains appear poised for the most financial-friendly blockchain tech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/business/21722869-anti-establishment-technology-faces-ironic-turn-fortune-governments-may-be-big-backers\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://www.economist.com/news/business/21722869-anti-establishment-technology-faces-ironic-turn-fortune-governments-may-be-big-backers</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bard.edu/library/arendt/pdfs/Sartre-Search.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<i> Search for a Method</i>, Jean-Paul Sartre, 1957</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n<small>Sartre would later be awarded the Nobel Prize in 1964, but declined it.</small>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"https://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">4.

The 4th through 7th outlined Features of the New Blockchain\r\nMicro-Economy</small>\r\n</h6>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">I feel that data is one of the more underestimated new commodities of the age. Most visualize data as rows and columns,\r\nand at most only non-conditional dynamic data. Data are not so mute! Data, in most object-oriented languages at\r\nleast, represents\r\n<i>functions</i>, conditions, and predicted values. And so, our own behavior, coupled with our networks&#39; behavior,\r\ncoupled with predictive analytics--this represents a wealth of information beyond our attributed or inherited traits.\r\nThe programming is\r\n<i>in</i> the data, however, citizens have become less and less involved, ceding app by centralized app our own information\r\nand ensuring profit to 3rd party marketers. The centralized nature of the internet allows for this, while the new\r\nlandscape of\r\n<i>decentralized applications</i> (DAPP) completely upends this structure of the status quo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>IV. Enabling citizens to own &amp; monetize their data (&amp; protect privacy)</strong>\r\n<br /> Ethereum offers a decentralized solution to &quot;owning&quot; one&#39;s own data, as data can be decentralized\r\nand returned to the individual&#39;s control, and\r\n<i>profit</i>. As sure as the 19th century&#39;s &quot;labor-hour&quot; became commodified to a calculable asset, i.e.\r\nproperty, which\r\n<i>another</i> party controls and makes profit; And as sure as the 20th century&#39;s data analytics became commodified\r\ninto calculable assets for another party to take control and make profit; then only now in this 21st century does\r\ntechnology offer a new, more egalitarian path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>V. Ensuring compensation for the Creators of Value </strong>\r\n<br /> So, how would decentralized innovations of blockchain\r\n<i>distributed ledger</i> technology compensate those whose actions, behavior, opinions, friend-networks, artwork,\r\nmusic, videos and other contributions profit the creator?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>VI. The Halcyon Age of Transaction-Chain Enterprise</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">According to Greek Mythology, the days of eery, noticeable lack of storms have never been interpreted as a period\r\nof grace. Moreso,\r\n<i>Halcyon</i> tranquility only means a temporary moratorium on the winds and waves, imposed by Aeolus, God of Wind,\r\nto protect the nesting eggs of Alcyone, his daughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If blockchain tech changes how we do research, analysis, and forecasting, as much as it changes international, and\r\ncross-industry transactions, then are we faced with a similar dilemma as the &quot;novelty&quot;, and double-dealing,\r\nof multi-nationals of the 1990s? No, because blockchain renders organizations, even those with a spotty past, into\r\ntransparent, democratic, efficient, secure and easily scrutinized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, without transparent proof, how else would I know my bananas are the &quot;pura vida&quot; Costa Rique&ntilde;\r\nones? More importantly, what was the carbon footprint of that banana&#39;s journey from its native soil to my breakfast\r\ntable? New blockchain companies like\r\n<a href=\"https://www.provenance.org/\">Provenance.org</a>,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.skuchain.com/\" target=\"_blank\">skuchain</a>,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blockverify.io/\">http://www.blockverify.io/</a> are a few noticeable game-changers. So, for bananas not backed by mathematical proofs,\r\nI really have to ask myself, is it\r\n<i>really</i> an authentic Fair Trade banana?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transactions are hardly valuable in the products themselves, if removed from the value of the\r\n<i>transaction per se</i>. International supply chain transactions, by virtue of a recently possible decentralized,\r\npermanent record and monitoring, have begun to make inroads in agriculture, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, food-supply\r\nand other multi-stage industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If corporate and governmental transactions are to be made public--many bearing enterprise or State secrets, then\r\nwill forecasting also go the way of birds? Possibly. Online platforms like Augur\r\n<sup id=\"20-8\">8</sup>are creating global, decentralized prediction markets, in domains like sports betting, financial markets\r\nspeculation and so forth. Armed with vast, transparent knowledge, the everyday person can now access the whims and\r\npower of Aeolus, and forecasting the winds of Fortune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>VII.

With all our technology, we just can&#39;t wait to hear the latest\r\ngossip about sister Becky&#39;s Boyfriend&#39;s Brother&#39;s Friend that\r\n<i>also</i> got to meet Shakira. Gossip to one person is a valuable asset to the data analyst. Because, how else could\r\nan algorithm draw simultaneous conclusions about two friends that &quot;liked&quot; the same Samsung VR, and that\r\nthey are both located near Best Buy. Thanks to classificatorial wisdom of AI &amp; plain machine-learning?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These relational queries are simply too difficult for relational, row &amp; column SQL data structures. In fact,\r\nmany queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures. Next, with the need to &quot;objectify&quot;\r\ndata into non-relational objects, rather than an antiquated, rigid row-and-column design. Thus, the second major\r\ntype of data structure is more flexible and adept in finding these relational queries that are ever more in vogue.\r\nHowever, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational, No-SQL designs quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability.\r\nBetween a rock and a hard place, a third data structure has emerged in recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graph Data Structures\r\n<sup>2</sup> allow data queries that had otherwise been impossible to capture in an entity relationship diagram. The\r\nideal example to clarify is the manner that the Swiss banks&#39; accounts were discovered to be hiding vast amounts\r\nof hidden taxes, etc. The cover-up was so well-constructed that not until new, graph database queries discovered\r\npatterns of money flow\r\n<sup>1</sup>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">The data was then turned into a graph format to detect then fine-tune the connections between the nodes. The Swiss\r\nLeak held around 60,000 files that contained information about over 100,000 clients in 203 countries, which means\r\nthat the resulting graph database had more than 275,000 nodes with 400,000 relationships among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections\r\nthan they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and regulators\r\nacross the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And you thought that plagiarism-detecting software was impressive for complexity! The beauty of this newly available\r\nsoftware (even Microsoft jumped on board in recent years) means that sociologists, economists can begin to make\r\nbetter headway in the way that our many interactions become more complex with more data. Remember, in the past ten\r\nminutes, more data information was just produced than most of human history! Thus, new and upcoming needs in domains\r\nlike content management &amp; access control, geo-routing (public transportation), gene sequencing, bio-informatics,\r\nand so on. So, as technology takes us forward, and we make our considerations, let&#39;s stick by the golden rules\r\nof parallel processing, scalability, and, now, graph-network mindedness for the new data structures, and schema,\r\nof the Era!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/how-a-graph-database-unearthed-major-financial-improprieties/\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\"> https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/how-a-graph-database-unearthed-major-financial-improprieties/ </a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"https://neo4j.com/blog/analyzing-panama-papers-neo4j/\">By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections\r\nthan they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and regulators\r\nacross the globe. </a>\r\n<br /> Other major vendors in graph data structures based on Neo4j: OrientDB, ArangoDB, Titan, mongoDB, Complexible Stardog,\r\nand Franz AllegroGraph.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-21\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech\">OUR DAILY TECH</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 22, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Languages</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">While I&#39;ve had blockchain-related topics on the mind lately, it seems I can&#39;t escape it as I broach new fields--blockchain\r\nis everywhere! Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated speed of language and syntax formation,\r\nand the curious phenomenon I&#39;d call, for lack of a better word or or my own reading, &quot;declarative-syntax-merging&quot;.\r\nThis involves the curious, and largely unknown, growth of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain\r\nof web apps, data analysis, and even the bounds of\r\n<i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won&#39;t submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say that, &quot;If\r\na certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed in JavaScript.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without getting into technicals, I&#39;ll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged with\r\nFrench, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand years later,\r\nwe can see how English grammar inherited it&#39;s Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the core vocabulary;\r\nThen, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;house&quot;\r\nfrom &quot;melche&quot; or &quot;haus&quot;, then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from\r\nFrench, e.g. &quot;lactose&quot; or &quot;mansion&quot; from &quot;lait&quot; or &quot;maison&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new language called\r\nSolidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English&#39;s time. The usual FOMO logic propels coding language use,\r\nfor example FOMO induced Microsoft&#39;s flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt it years ago.\r\n<sup id=\"22-1\">1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents, one non-legitimate.\r\nIt is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of C++. For the layperson, let&#39;s\r\njust say Solidity resembles a &quot;Liger&quot;, in it is at it&#39;s core JavaScript, yet with increasing sophistication\r\nbased on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the powerful machine-code of C++ ever more. And it\r\nis a beautiful, but curious phenomonenon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/microsoft-adds-ethereum-language-solidity-visual-studio-1552171\">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/microsoft-adds-ethereum-language-solidity-visual-studio-1552171</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-23\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech\">OUR DAILY TECH</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 23, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">1.4 Million Reasons for more Women in Tech</h6>\r\n<a href=\"#18-03-08\" rel=\"stylesheet\">Blog addressed again March 8, 2018 </a>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">1.4 million\r\n<i>new</i> jobs by 2020; End over end, year after year, the computer programming industry continues to add another\r\n20% more jobs each year, for the next five years.

Silicon Valley is, at its best, obscenely\r\none-sided. At Google, only 17% of the company&#39;s tech jobs are filled by women. Facebook women staff only 15%\r\nof tech jobs, and Twitter? 10% female. The figures on women in computer science across the nation, across the entire\r\nindustry are not improving, but\r\n<i>declining</i>?\r\n<sup>1</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, we&#39;ve heard these statistics from any given headline, and in the halls across the university landscape,\r\nstarting with Women in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Mathematics) programs.\r\n<sup>3</sup> Yet, why, with so much money, so many programs, so many non-governmental, non-profit effort?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I argue that tech\r\n<i>climate </i> is directly to blame. Who then? Not a person, but principles are to blame. Culture--often defined as\r\nshared beliefs, norms, language and behaviors--can hardly be changed, but it can be understood.\r\n<br /> There is a book, called &quot;Program or be Programmed\r\n<sup id=\"24-4\">4</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n, by which the author explains social consequences of a dichotomized society--between those that manipulate the environment\r\naround them, whether automating tasks at work, or simply fixing a simple software bug, by adding a comma. This literacy\r\nof the Current Era is akin to the 26-letter alphabet of written sentences and paragraphs, and--not to be taken for\r\ngranted--is the exclusive form of communication, outside of a 100-foot perimeter, up until 150 years ago. Knowledge\r\nis not power, the communication of knowledge is power.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I argue that today, the power is to program one application programming interface (API) to talk to another API. In\r\nother words, the ability to directly communicate with software at the command-line is not now a requisite skill,\r\nbut promotions would not escape this necessity! So, now reverting back to the subject of women in tech, American\r\nleadership is in deep peril without more female insight. I will finish by citing that Ares, the violent, untamed\r\nGreek\r\n<i>god of war</i>, cannot always drive the Capitalist engine; because She, Athena, the\r\n<i>goddess of intelligence</i> represents true strategy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"https://fairygodboss.com/articles/women-in-tech-facts-figures-and-percentages\" target=\"_blank\">https://fairygodboss.com/articles/women-in-tech-facts-figures-and-percentages</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-24\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech\">OUR DAILY TECH</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 24-25, 2018\r\n<br /> Weekend\r\n</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Joys of Automation</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">While coding up a better shell for this website, I thought it&#39;s remarkable how our lives get easier and easier\r\nwith each passing year of tech. Using JavaScript--the primordial web-coding language--I marvel at the convenience\r\nof delegating mundande coding stuff to taskrunners, like\r\n<i>Gulp</i>--a programmable package manager that &quot;bundles&quot; up the libraries to be used in the app. It is\r\ntruly a joy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I write four styling\r\n<i>functions</i>, with about 16\r\n<i>variables</i> and voil&agrave;!

Instead, now, it&#39;s as though I wind up the clock, and need only periodically check, and perhaps\r\nupdate a variable or two ... Technology. I&#39;m gushing for joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was mere JavaScript--with a truly\r\n<i>Turing Complete</i>--pan-algorithm status--languages, the possibilities are 100-fold with Python language library\r\ncollection; this library collection includes NASA modules, mathematical proofs, and limitless uses from web-scraping\r\nfor unstructured data to an excellent data visualization collection. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m in the Library\r\nof Congress, and better yet because, PIP, the Python package manager acts and automates like a cyborg librarian,\r\nfor lack of better imagery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just have so much joy watching a project come to life, and it&#39;s even a greater delight if this project comes\r\nto life and stays alive, through the joys of automation!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-26\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech\">OUR DAILY TECH</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 26, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Cryptocurrency&#39;s Cumbersome Carbon Footprint</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">I must confess that on the very day that Our Daily Tech Blog gets an under-the-head make-over for security&#39;s\r\nsake, I wrote the new formatting file right over today&#39;s post. Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously\r\nas I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether I change my\r\nways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely, Sustainability, a.k.a.\r\nCarbon Footprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms that build\r\na record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a bitcoin for their efforts.\r\n<sup id=\"explain\">1</sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high electricity\r\nbills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity is gobbled up by small\r\nand large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations!\r\n<sup id=\"electricity\">1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other &quot;Proof-of-Work&quot; designs require electricity because\r\nthe investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for mining drives\r\nthe system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, is the electricity consumption really\r\n<i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis site\r\n<sup\r\nid=\"digiconomist\">3</sup> estimates\r\n<i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity&#39;s mining. (A visa credit card transaction\r\nis 0.00651 kWh. The entire Ethereum global blockchain could be &quot;using as much as 4.2 Terawatt-hours (tWh),\r\nor slightly more than the country of Cyprus\r\n<sup id=\"cyprus\">1</sup>.&quot; So, electricity comparisons are telling, but how does this relate to its environment impact, sustainability\r\nitself?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carbon Footprint, our energy consumption index, can be compared to another element of scarcity, which dictates fluctuations\r\nin value: Gold. According to\r\n<i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household&#39;s Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article does\r\nthe math for us very succinctly:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just more energy-intensive, but also has\r\na bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon footprint for both.\r\nFor Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. For gold, we assume a carbon\r\nfootprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined\r\n<sup id=\"digiconomist2\">3</sup>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin&#39;s worth\r\nof Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2). At the end of the day, the electricity costs--if not sustainable long-term--could\r\nspell trouble. Hence, the three S&#39;s, mentioned last, sustainability is perhaps a larger issue than blockchain\r\nSecurity and Scalability challenges. Again, this is a problem that the third largest cryptocurrency does not have:\r\n<i>Ripple</i>, which does not bear a carbon footprint\r\n<sup id=\"ripple\">4</sup>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>0.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/bitcoin-ethereum-or-litecoin-which-cryptocurrency-is-best-for-you/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnet.com/how-to/bitcoin-ethereum-or-litecoin-which-cryptocurrency-is-best-for-you/</a>\r\n<br /> For those new to cryptocurrencies, this is a fairly succinct article to cryptocurrencies, and their underlying\r\nstructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.\r\n<a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3zn9a/ethereum-mining-transaction-electricity-consumption-bitcoin\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3zn9a/ethereum-mining-transaction-electricity-consumption-bitcoin</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-mining-really-use\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-mining-really-use</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.\r\n<a href=\"https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-mining-more-polluting-than-gold-mining\" target=\"_blank\">https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-mining-more-polluting-than-gold-mining</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.\r\n<a href=\"https://ripple.com/xrp/\" target=\"_blank\">https://ripple.com/xrp/</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feb 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-02-27\">\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#top\"><button>Top</button></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5 class=\"title dailytech\">OUR DAILY TECH</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber\">Feb 27, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">After Yesterday&#39;s Scathing Post, A Look at my own Carbon Footprint</h6>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"firstparagraph\">In my reflections about environment sustainability issues, I confess I&#39;m sort of a hypocrite ... The whole matter\r\nthat caused my own introspection begins with my usual daily vexation: Tangles of wires!\r\n<br /> &nbsp; ... I&#39;ve been having electricity issues, here as of late ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On one side, my tiny Yoga Ultrabook usually likes to charge just fine with my phone charger--if I&#39;m stuck without\r\nmy charger. And due to an untimely end to the charger, I needed a replacement. So, singular errand of the day was\r\na trip to Best Buy to peruse for a 45-Watt USB-C charger ( the new oval charging port on Samsung 8&#39;s, LG G6&#39;s\r\nand newer Apple products).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, my credit-card sized Raspberry Pi computer runs on an old-school USB charger--a whole Linux Server Tower\r\non a cell-phone charger. Then, we have my trusty Dell (actual) Tower with 16 Gigs of RAM, 2-terabytes, etc. that\r\nalso seems to need an extra fan to stay cool--probably the sustainability of 100 Raspberry computers. My entire\r\ncarbon footprint changes more with the electrical products that I use, than my vehicle! Well, I also confess my\r\nJeep Cherokee can&#39;t even boast 20 miles per hour ... oops, conscience pangs, ouch ...

These two are\r\n<strong>&quot;Proof of Work&quot; currency algorithsms</strong>. This means that the &quot;Demand&quot; side of supply-and-demand,\r\nderives from\r\n<i>difficulty levels</i> of crypto-blocks to mine.

(takes about 12 minutes for the whole global blockchain to cycle, and Ethereum\r\nis less than a minute). So, the whole cycle continues, churning through coal- and carbon-stained hands of the electricity\r\nfed to these crypto-mining rigs\r\n<sup>1</sup>. For many it&#39;s a hobby, like the British Hobbyists&#39; love for ham- and short-wave radio setups, yet\r\nthis profitable, yet particular hobby resembles the 1870&#39;s coal factory smoke stacks in South London!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s face it, if Ethereum is able to successfully hard-fork to a Proof-of-Stake system soon--and Vitalik Buterin\r\nand his crew assure us it is coming\r\n<sup>2</sup>--then great--problem solved, everything eventually converts to Ethereum.

These blockchain \"network\" analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network\r\n                    changes, node changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly\r\n                    or not. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships)\r\n                    that include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain\r\n                    tech must face analytical challenges that arise from informal practices\r\n                    <sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role's protocol\r\n                    for the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p> Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan's (1977)\r\n                    <i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple\r\n                    <i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time,\r\n                    convenience, etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm\r\n                    human understanding\r\n                    <i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of\r\n                    a bank, a person, or a company's internal bot? </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought\r\n                    the world the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can only contribute little on how to interface\r\n                    with social needs. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the\r\n                    multi-dimensional layers of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks? Well\r\n                    enough to differentiate qualitative meaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved,\r\n                    integrated through multiple layers of \"middlemen\", such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions,\r\n                    non-governmental, non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases\r\n                    the middlemen. Suddenly, one programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract,\r\n                    that last month an entire team of hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing\r\n                    different facets of this same thing. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the\r\n                    life of the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years' Sociology Network\r\n                    Analysts' research and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and\r\n                    should not turn to the Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already\r\n                    at home, safe within the academic domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and\r\n                    so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology can either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances,\r\n                    accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises. Or, the next ten years can follow Sociology's\r\n                    Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful future. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on review\r\n                    of the Sociologists' specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships,\r\n                    within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships.\r\n                    We Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary,\r\n                    yet are characterized by fixed patterns. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes\r\n                    that characterize societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large\r\n                    Number Statistical Theory become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900's Sociological French Network\r\n                    Theories, like Maurice Halbswach's work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society's Collective\r\n                    Memory.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic's \"irrational behaviors\"\r\n                    and Mathematical \"complexity models\" do not\r\n                    <i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate\r\n                    simultaneous node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/\r\n                    only 3 of 15 network groups get jobs), and most importantly the\r\n                    <i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time\r\n                    and fixed. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>Fine. So, why is Sociology's network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th\r\n                    and 20th centuries' network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era,\r\n                    while </strong> North American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960's [post-1968],\r\n                    U.S. in the 1990's[post-1999], in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of\r\n                    past sociology are inherently small-data and more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates\r\n                    \"human-ness\" into the billion rows and columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation\r\n                    for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of\r\n                    each relationship (link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or\r\n                    is changed; with this, it is possible to isolate directional, conditional\r\n                    <i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation\r\n                    <sup id=\"9one\">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on\r\n                    social networks. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person\r\n                    <i>self-selects</i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group's\r\n                    behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group's\r\n                    behavior, by the group's influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder's SIENA software,\r\n                    achieves the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology.\r\n                    The network graph can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety\r\n                    without hard forks), not as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary\r\n                    assumptions that a set of nodes (social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are\r\n                    known - except perhaps for a moderate amount of missing data</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear,\r\n                    directed path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists\r\n                    are called upon, blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again\r\n                    the same bugs. Sadly, this semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain\r\n                    for their currency, contract, and other societal needs--in this case, the blind will indeed lead the\r\n                    blind. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"footnotes\">\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/226550\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"9one\">1. http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/226550</a>\r\n                    <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <a href=\"https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"9one\">2. https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div id=\"18-02-11\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH: </h5>\r\n                  <h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Web Dev Affairs</h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <h6 class=\"chapternumber\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Feb 11, 2018</h6>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">How Can We Best Modularize our App Designs in Order to Achieve the Much Vaunted \"Separation of Concerns\"?</h6>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"firstparagraph\">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed\r\n                    Order of Coders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from\r\n                    structural design.

So, if a decade ago three teams handled\r\n                    html, js, css, it is now requisite to divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget,\r\n                    a team for the navigation widgets, and\r\n                    <i> each</i> of these component teams\r\n                    <strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module's required html, js, css. </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and all coding\r\n                    will necessarily begin to 'reinvent the wheel.' This is because any module, any library you go to, will\r\n                    <i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate\r\n                    new css from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual\r\n                    misery, almost instantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher\r\n                    level of abstraction, leaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice\r\n                    in the modern world, and if ad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity?\r\n                    If yesterday's craft was the hoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular\r\n                    coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part by part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses\r\n                    and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and pastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry.\r\n                    Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module definition? That's absurd. Equally absurd is the\r\n                    javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an\r\n                    age that each year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic\r\n                    sugar and also fundamental structure--especially the importing and exporting of modules.

Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation\r\n                    were not entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural\r\n                    changes from higher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in\r\n                    their content and influence) begin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends\r\n                    and opinionated critical thought becomes dominated by the relationships, e.g., the \"likes\" and \"shares\",\r\n                    leading to a statistically natural propensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is\r\n                    akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel to the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure),\r\n                    a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal and tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers\r\n                    out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary\r\n                    <i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>\r\n                  <p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual \"interruptions\" that\r\n                    previously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains: </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"quote\">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication\r\n                    that the timespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation\r\n                    Bias, misinformation and outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that\r\n                    are already hard to change. </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,\r\n                    <i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network\r\n                    phenomonenon--ultimately driven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry,\r\n                    conditional influences, and the strength of ties outweighing network nodes.

The past 50 years' social changes and\r\n                    new problems are generally atrributed for the increasing demand for sociological expertise after 1999,\r\n                    after a singular, senseless tragedy of a school shooting--this event, like a small kernel of societal\r\n                    desperation for a solution--led to a flurry of self-professed sociologists &agrave; la Michael Moore's\r\n                    Colombine, and other social-responsibility themed social consciousness. So far, only mutually incompatible\r\n                    solutions. The problem, however, is not new, only the manifestation of it.</p>\r\n                  <p>Suicide rates in 19th century France, disproportionately high, also served as a symptomatic manifestation\r\n                    of the same problem, called\r\n                    <i>Anomie.</i>\r\n                    <sup>1</sup> The term,\r\n                    <i>Anomie</i>, coined by Emile Durkheim in the late 1800's, captured the sense of instability, cultural\r\n                    and moral relativism that undermined a shared sense of meaning. Suicides, week-after-week, month-after-month?\r\n                    In 1897 France, noone had ever seen it before--at such rates--and people wanted answers. Alas, a kernel\r\n                    of social desperation leading to inquiry.</p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    People wanted to know why so many in the population responded negatively to the rapid changes, urbanization (Dreadful factory\r\n                    conditions &agrave; la\r\n                    <i>Taylorism's</i> calculated efficiency) new technologies, i.e. electricity, railroads, steam engines;\r\n                    these created an arbitrarily new world, very suddenly.

Sure, it's\r\n                    more of a \"metropolitan\" phenomenon; and sure, it's become an accepted global platform--along with myriad\r\n                    other crypto-currencies, but it's exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies\r\n                    are useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency's\r\n                    rise to fame with last year's increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its\r\n                    contributions, uses, fame are one-sidedly\r\n                    <i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article\r\n                    <sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of\r\n                    <i>actual</i> use at the \"cash-registers\" of society.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological\r\n                    <i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Roger's Diffusion of Innovations\r\n                    <sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger's bell\r\n                    curve ranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However,\r\n                    the blockchain articles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine\r\n                    usefulness for the every-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is\r\n                    <i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific\r\n                    information--whether financial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order\r\n                    before I continue, since we can all relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most\r\n                    notably concerning Target store credit card hacks a couple years ago. </p>\r\n                  <p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions,\r\n                    this person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction:\r\n                    they prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that\r\n                    $27, $200, or $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their\r\n                    <i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and\r\n                    if the store's databases are hacked, then tough-luck! </p>\r\n                  <p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for\r\n                    each transaction, providing the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient!\r\n                    Nobody thinks to walk around with their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad\r\n                    of cash and peel out a bill. The credit card system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology\r\n                    to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions have had to rely on the many layers of security,\r\n                    passwords, pins, mothers' maiden names, etc. Then, based on the mathematics behind prime numbers, they\r\n                    hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright red target on it. </p>\r\n                  <p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And\r\n                    that, my friends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency,\r\n                    instead the crypto-\r\n                    <i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero's\r\n                    name is the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide\r\n                    pinpointed,\r\n                    <i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for\r\n                    the sake of renting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don't\r\n                    need this.

In\r\n                    my February 15th\r\n                    <a href=\"#18-02-15\">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects\r\n                    of the crypto-contract horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    <strong>Prologue</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the\r\n                    <i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals?\r\n                    First, a little background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum\r\n                    blockchain helps distinguish itself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech,\r\n                    like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based blockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming\r\n                    features, e.g. \"looping\", \"recursion\", with the full power of a\r\n                    <i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable\r\n                    problem. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the\r\n                    accounting system of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction,\r\n                    An Ethereum blockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,\r\n                    <i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks\r\n                    to calculate into a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>Therefore, Ethereum's Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum\r\n                    blockchain is actually a \"Virtual Machine\", like a a big networked \"home computer\". The native language\r\n                    of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an\r\n                    <i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home\r\n                    computer, then directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman's terms, the manner that\r\n                    modern-day app, for example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that\r\n                    allows one programming system to interact with another, such as Instragram offers a \"sharing API\" that\r\n                    connects to hardware contacts, thus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing\r\n                    your instagram picture to your Facebook account, via your T-Mobile phone's contacts list. This API relationship\r\n                    broadly describes the modern world we live in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information\r\n                    with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system, which exchanges API information with your own contact list,\r\n                    and so on, and our lives are made easier. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity\r\n                    days; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise.\r\n                    The reason being that digital math uses binary \"on/off\" calculations, while quantum math implicates a\r\n                    tertiary,\r\n                    <i>qubit</i> \"simultaneous states\". Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology,\r\n                    both programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA's blockchain\r\n                    design utilizes a\r\n                    <i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one's transaction is entered into with a private-key, and\r\n                    the blockchain moreso resembles a \"Tangle\" of a directed graph, which allows for computational \"states\".\r\n                    IOTA recently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent\r\n                    vulnerability. In truth, this was a case of user-error because users were\r\n                    <i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer\r\n                    could crack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough\r\n                    now to cause damage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum\r\n                    possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the\r\n                    trees. Social useablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun\r\n                    to emerge, at least in form, with little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd\r\n                    generation Patrician directed graph blockchain. The underlying principle of the blockchain's micro-economic\r\n                    utiliity through crypto-\r\n                    <i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions\r\n                    for Supply &amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of\r\n                    the Hard Sciences of Mathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div id=\"18-02-19\">\r\n                  <h5 class=\"title dailytech\">OUR DAILY TECH</h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <h6 class=\"chapternumber\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Feb 19, 20189</h6>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Blockchains, Bitcoins and The Unnecessary Risk of Shopping at Target with a Credit Card, Part III:\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <br />Seven Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy\r\n                    <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <small class=\"jargon\">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity!

Then, the primacy\r\n                    of the\r\n                    <i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then\r\n                    other Paradigm Shifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment\r\n                    authors of 17th, 18th century. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era's emerging\r\n                    paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority and responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment.\r\n                    <i>Historical Materialism</i>\r\n                    <sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from\r\n                    governmental, financial sources, but rather the\r\n                    <i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the\r\n                    revolutionary shift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable\r\n                    data-sharing. Cryptography has in a sense become a\r\n                    <i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <strong>I.

The modern\r\n                    period also has held this decentralized, individual authority as the\r\n                    <i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions\r\n                    of humankind, not idealogies. In fact, it was the\r\n                    <i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western\r\n                    Philosophy, by laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical \"ground\" upward. This \"upside-down\r\n                    tree\" defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of\r\n                    <i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism,\r\n                    as argued in Sartre's\r\n                    <i>Search for a Method</i>.\r\n                    <sup>3</sup>\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations\r\n                    since Hegel. I'm so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels.\r\n                    First, cryptography resemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern\r\n                    social rule (Some once thought nuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown.\r\n                    Secondly, I'm still dumbfounded that a Paradigm Shift\r\n                    <i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for\r\n                    a society that is provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    <strong>II.

The potential for removing the\r\n                    \"middle-person\" from the day-to-day, micro-economic \"cost of living\".

While the exponential population growth looms\r\n                    on the near horizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on\r\n                    <i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient\r\n                    by means of blockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing,\r\n                    etc. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    <strong>III.

In\r\n                    fact, many queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures.

However, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational, No-SQL designs\r\n                    quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability.

Almost a thousand\r\n                    years later, we can see how English grammar inherited it's Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the\r\n                    core vocabulary; Then, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. \"milk\"\r\n                    or \"house\" from \"melche\" or \"haus\", then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from\r\n                    French, e.g. \"lactose\" or \"mansion\" from \"lait\" or \"maison\".</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new\r\n                    language called Solidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English's time. The usual FOMO logic propels\r\n                    coding language use, for example FOMO induced Microsoft's flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt\r\n                    it years ago.\r\n                    <sup id=\"22-1\">1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents,\r\n                    one non-legitimate.

It <i>did</i> let us, our whole society, let us down, and maybe the forensics will give us <i>a few excuses</i> down on the road. However, \"homicide by A.I. (aka Uber)\" will need to be updated in records. But, artificial intelligence is not at fault. There are a few software engineers that did the best they could--with the time their superiors gave them.  Uber leadership, let's hope, will be deterred from future carelessnes to come.   </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>That diatribe said, I do appreciate an Uber's proximity when I'm stranded at 2:00 am in a bad part of town. Why? Because I don't need to plan ahead -- Uber is there! And, sadly, I don't need to read or study -- Google is there! But wait, don't judge me, I'm not lazy! That being said, I have my own soul-searching to do: TECHNOLOGY AIDS AND ABETS ME AND MY ACTIONS, but it does not run my show> Only I take responsibility for my own actions: I allow technology into my life as a tool, and yet I   hold the power cord.

Like it or not, A.I. will need to 3-D print the dykes for the sunken coastal cities--like tiny island Den Haague, the most beautiful city in the world. Next, A.I. will make irrelevant fossil fuels by 2030, if not before; and those caught polluting would be fined to death, anyway. Without A.I., none of these worthwhile goals are possible. This precarious, difficult and most of all laborious job of designing our own solutions will take time: For this reason, Uber should be shamed even further for their short-cuts, and eventual errors of internal, organizational problems. <i>Uber's experiemental, tax-free \"Testing Sandbox\" cannot be the erstwhile safe neighborhoods of Surburban Phoenix, without proper caution.</i> </p>\t\t\r\n      <p>Are Uber's corporate desires, market stronghold, and shareholders' delight more worthwhile than <i>an entire sensitive field of machine-learning research?</i> No. Uber must be warned to not steal corporate secrets from Waymo, then proceed to be 86'd from California, then brush aside with excuses the <i>killing of an innocent Arizona bicyclist</i>.</p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      Who can count the number of very feisty taxi-men and -women that are not fans of the infamously hasty culture of Uber.

Although we could all debate the merits of \"Lidar\", i.e. laser-based vision, the primary concern, in my view, is Uber's obvious carelessness in rushing their self-driving tech.  Although six thousand (6,000 too many) pedestrians are killed in the U.S. annually, I'd only hope AI wouldn't add to the problem.<sup>2</sup> The Arizona victim was walking her bicycle when struck, and I as bike-commuter can't help but take the affair personally. </p>\r\n      <p>This first human death is at least a <strong>big Wake-Up moment</strong> for the industry in its haste to roll out A.I. tech.  After all, Uber's questionable leadership morals<sup>2</sup> and being kicked out of San Francisco for running more than six red-lights raises eyebrows to begin with.<sup>3</sup> My problem with Uber is that the car's algorithm, with perfect Lidar vision, did not flinch or slow down for two seconds as it killed the victim. Humans flinch and humans swerve, because protecting fellow humans is in our DNA, not in A.I.'s.

This is because data and data research\r\n      is innate to the university's Mission Statement, whereas business and governmental institutions are relatively new\r\n      to the game, and often at odds with the\r\n      <i>Academy</i>, and occasionally against each other. </p>\r\n      <p class=\"quote\">Threats to student data privacy existed long before the internet. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover infiltrated Berkeley\r\n      student groups to counter communism in the 1960s. Around the same time, the CIA manipulated the National Student\r\n      Association for intelligence gathering in other anti-communism efforts. But the privacy issue is more acute now\r\n      that the amount of student data in cloud-based systems has grown exponentially and is more widely dispersed.\r\n      <sup>2</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p> The University's expertise over ethically regulated data collection and management, is better than government, business,\r\n      and even medical domains for two reasons. First, the institution's long history and ethical motives with data are\r\n      unique. The norms of data-handling have been codified through the University's Institutional Review Board based\r\n      on its\r\n      <strong>stated mission</strong>. In other words, Universities take data seriously\r\n      <i>for reasons other than corporate profit or governmental control</i>. An example of personal data precautions has\r\n      played out with Harvard's recent data tiffs leading to the Supreme Court, illustrated by a 2016 article: </p>\r\n      <p class=\"quote\">Last week undergraduates at Harvard University raised concerns about the institution handing over their data to an\r\n      anti-affirmative action group as part of a lawsuit. Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing the university\r\n      for allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants, will have access to “academic, extracurricular,\r\n      demographic and other information” from all undergrads who applied to Harvard between the fall 2009 and spring 2015,\r\n      omitting names and Social Security numbers.\r\n      <sup>2</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>The second reason why Universities understand ethical implications for data is that data and more broadly data and\r\n      human information\r\n      <i>research</i> is the institutions' second highest priority, along with teaching and service. For example, in response\r\n      to the unethical Public Health research in\r\n      <i>Tuskegee Syphilis experiements</i>, the University instution\r\n      <i>stepped in</i> to help design the 1978\r\n      <strong>Belmont Principles</strong>. Currently, the University Institutional Review Board incorporates this with the Nuremburg\r\n      Code (developed after WWII NAZI research), in handling data research.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>In recent days,\r\n      <i>private companies</i> claim expertise for regulating \"Fake News\", and you guessed it,\r\n      <strong>regulation of data privacy &amp; confidentiality.</strong><sup>3</sup> The ethical authority over data privacy norms are nowhere\r\n      else than the University campus, case in point Harvard... Let the governments govern and the enterprises enterprise,\r\n      and leave the\r\n      <i>thoughtful, ethical regulation of data collection and precaution </i> to the Ivory Tower. Corporate and Government\r\n      self-regulation is opaque enough!</p>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"cite\">1.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/21/mark-zuckerberg-response-facebook-cambridge-analytica\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/21/mark-zuckerberg-response-facebook-cambridge-analytica</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"cite\">2.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-10-26-pursuing-academic-freedom-and-data-privacy-is-a-balancing-act\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\">https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-10-26-pursuing-academic-freedom-and-data-privacy-is-a-balancing-act</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"cite\">3.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/paul-ford-facebook-is-why-we-need-a-digital-protection-agency\"\r\n      target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/paul-ford-facebook-is-why-we-need-a-digital-protection-agency</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div id=\"18-03-19\" class=\"  mar 18-03 -19\">\r\n      \r\n      <hr />\r\n      <button>\r\n      <a href=\"#martop\">Top</a>\r\n      </button>&nbsp;\r\n      <h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\r\n      \r\n      <h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"  chapternumber\">March 19, 2018</h6>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">A New Politics of Power:\r\n      <br /> The Cryptographic Financial Escape Hatch\r\n      </h6>\r\n      <p>I had originally intended for a post on the very lamentable\r\n      <i>Blockbuster-ization</i> and eventual demise of Toys-\"R\"-Us, but Tech Affairs happen too quickly!

Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country\r\n      had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation’s vast petroleum reserves.\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation\r\n      of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation.\r\n      <sup>1</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      This turn of events, both Maduro et al.'s financial cleverness and Trump's action to de-legitimate the Petro crypto-currency,\r\n      are examples of the undefined, near-limitless political uses for Blockchain Tech, both offensively and defensively.\r\n      In fact, the ensuing events may be of great interest as we will witness a major first actual use-case of the decentralizing\r\n      aims of crypto-technology tool. A tool that softens the financial leverage wielded by centralized authorities, whether\r\n      governmental or private.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>I used the term \"de-legitimate\" above because there are two processes at work: First, crypto-currencies are\r\n      <i>in themselves</i> not legitimate. A\r\n      <strong>crypto-currency platform gains legitimacy through a series of both technical and financial trust-building stages</strong>.\r\n      So legitimacy is earned first privately, and some currency platforms continue publicly to Initial Coin Offering,\r\n      and so on--purely financial and technical legitimacy.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>And then, there is the another kind of legitimacy, which involves political leverage ... </p>\r\n      <p class=\"cite\">1.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/world/americas/trump-venezuela-sanctions-petro.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/world/americas/trump-venezuela-sanctions-petro.html</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div id=\"18-03-17\" class=\"  mar 18-03 -17\">\r\n      \r\n      <hr />\r\n      <button>\r\n      <a href=\"#martop\">Top</a>\r\n      </button>&nbsp;\r\n      <h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\r\n      \r\n      <h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"  chapternumber\">March 17-18 2018\r\n      <br /> Weekend\r\n      </h6>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come, Part II: A Ripple and an Iota of Sustainable Crypto-Currency\r\n      </h6>\r\n      <p class=\"firstparagraph\">Iota and Ripple cryptocurrencies use different technology than traditional blockchain in order to achieve their distributed\r\n      ledgers. Traditionally, outside \"miners\" validate the block's\r\n      <i> transaction records</i> as it replicates to the next \"block.\" For example, a transaction is validated 2 or three\r\n      times, and since three miners' validations all agree, one is kept and two are destroyed, in a nutshell; one example\r\n      of computations (\r\n      <strong>and hence coal</strong>) that cost too much time and energy.</p>\r\n      <p>Unlike this arrangement, Iota, Ripple, and Hedera use a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) data structure (shaped like\r\n      a sideways genealogy tree) that relies on \"consensus\" from its nearest neighbor transaction nodes.\r\n      <sup>1</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>Enough with the jargon! The bottom line is that Bitcoin's tech is not eco-sustainable,\r\n      <sup>2</sup> and so alternatives are already closing in on Bitcoin. Iota, the 8th largest cryptocurrency Iota delivers\r\n      open-source transparency, lightning speed, and yet is it cryptographically sound? Not according to some tech pundits:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"quote\">You might think that IOTA, a cryptocurrency worth over a billion dollars, and working with organizations like Microsoft,\r\n      University College London, Innogy, and Bosch, BNY Mellon, Cisco, and Foxconn (through the Trusted IOT Alliance)\r\n      would not have fairly obvious vulnerabilities, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. When we took a look at their\r\n      system, we found a serious vulnerability and textbook insecure code.\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br /> “In 2017, leaving your crypto algorithm vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis is a rookie mistake. It says that\r\n      no one of any calibre analyzed their system, and that the odds that their fix makes the system secure is low,” states\r\n      Bruce Schneier, renowned security technologist, about IOTA when we shared our attack.\r\n      <sup>3</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>And so, with a 1.9 billion market cap, I sometimes have to reflect on the immensity and non-relational fact and figures\r\n      of our technological world! Security and other bugs are hard to avoid when an industry is moving too fast for thoroughly\r\n      tested betas; and each iteration involves a series of bug-patches, with short- and long-term priorities stretched\r\n      with new design &amp; function trade-offs.</p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      Full life-cycle software development, from napkin-idea to rolling specs, always follows these patterns yet not always with\r\n      so much money on the line! Here's a closer look at one critique of Iota:</p>\r\n      <p class=\"quote\">\r\n      IOTA developers had written their own hash function, it was a huge red flag ... I think it’s important to reiterate that\r\n      the IOTA developers do not agree with our characterization of this as an issue of concern. Our report lays out more\r\n      details about why we are concerned.\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br /> There are other red flags — unlike every other program running on your laptop or phone, IOTA uses ternary instead\r\n      of binary. Since all computer hardware today uses binary, IOTA converts to ternary in software, which is less efficient\r\n      and more complex. This complexity prevents IOTA from benefiting from existing security analysis tools that are designed\r\n      to work with binary, and makes the code harder to read and understand.\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br /> The current IOTA tangle requires a trusted party (the coordinator) for security, suggesting that in its current\r\n      form it’s not ready to run as a truly permissionless, decentralized system.\r\n      <sup>3</sup>\r\n      </p><p>\r\n      Optimizing, not sacrificing, should be the name of the game as Tech closes in on Blockchain challenges of security, scalability,\r\n      and that evers-so-costly\r\n      <strong>Sustainability!</strong>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>1.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/next-generation-crypto-ledgers-take-the-block-out-of-blockchain\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/next-generation-crypto-ledgers-take-the-block-out-of-blockchain</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>2.\r\n      <a href=\"\r\n      https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\r\n      \" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>3.\r\n      <a href=\"\r\n      https://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367\r\n      \" target=\"_blank\"> https://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div id=\"18-03-16\" class=\"  mar 18-03 -17\">\r\n      \r\n      <hr />\r\n      <button>\r\n      <a href=\"#martop\">Top</a>\r\n      </button>&nbsp;\r\n      <h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\r\n      \r\n      <h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"  chapternumber\">March 16, 2018</h6>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\"> Energy Alternatives Signal the Power Shift to Come\r\n      </h6>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"firstparagraph\">Sustainability for the environment means an accelerated transition to renewables.

Still classical Web 2.0, it's novelty appears so simple, almost intuitive in potentially new pathway:</p>\r\n      <p class=\"quote\">\"On Kickstarter and Indiegogo, creators essentially have to start over every time,\" says Danny Rimer, a partner at\r\n      Index Ventures who is a Patreon investor and board member. \"It's the same reason software companies went from licensed\r\n      software to subscriptions: predictable revenue and better service for customers.\"\r\n      <sup>4</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      Apparently Patreon, along with last November's\r\n      <i>Drip</i> by KickStarter have made headway. Patreon paid out $150 million to its artists in 2017, and each are doubling\r\n      annually. Decentralizing again. Well, we say we can't\r\n      <i>go back to the way it was</i>, but Tech always seems to lead us back to the way it was!\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>1.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/magazine/touring-cant-save-musicians-in-the-age-of-spotify.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/magazine/touring-cant-save-musicians-in-the-age-of-spotify.html\r\n      </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>2.\r\n      <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-new-album-reputation-not-on-spotify-apple-music-streaming-2017-11\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\">http://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-new-album-reputation-not-on-spotify-apple-music-streaming-2017-11\r\n      </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>3.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/business/media/taylor-swifts-stand-on-royalties-draws-a-rebuttal-from-spotify.html\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/business/media/taylor-swifts-stand-on-royalties-draws-a-rebuttal-from-spotify.html\r\n      </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      <p>4.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/02/13/digital-medici-how-this-musician-turned-entrepreneur-plans-to-save-creators-from-advertising/#6063ea771313\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/02/13/digital-medici-how-this-musician-turned-entrepreneur-plans-to-save-creators-from-advertising\r\n      </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div id=\"18-03-14\" class=\"  mar 18-03 -14\">\r\n      \r\n      <hr />\r\n      <button>\r\n      <a href=\"#martop\">Top</a>\r\n      </button>&nbsp;\r\n      <h4 class=\"  title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\r\n      \r\n      <h5 class=\"  subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"  author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"  chapternumber\">March 14, 2018</h6>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">\r\n      <i>Tou\r\n        <strong>Demou</strong> tes\r\n        <strong> Krates</strong>\r\n      </i>:\r\n      <br />Strength of the People</h6>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"firstparagraph\">Today's demonstrations and walk-outs, led by America's Youth and followed by many of the education staff, has aimed\r\n      directly at Gun-Control legislation. Yet, the message more powerfully articulated than ever by adolescent-turns-adult\r\n      students, takes aim at something further afield. </p>\r\n      <p>Students, remembering the February 14th massacre victims, take aim at the corruption stemming from the 2010 Supreme\r\n      Court \"Person-hood\" protection for Corporations, also known as the\r\n      <i>Citizens United</i> Decision. A dated, but poignant, article from National Public Radio explains:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"quote\">The Supreme Court extended that protection to corporations, and over time also extended some — but not all — of the\r\n      rights guaranteed to individuals in the Bill of Rights.\r\n      <sup>1</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      Yet, it appears deceptively harmless for Congressional Law-makers to protect corporations, in the form of\r\n      <strong>Gun Manufacturers' Lobbyists, </strong>\r\n      as equally as it protects humans. The origin or this ruling dates to a 70's Neo-Liberal, right-leaning legislation and Court\r\n      rulings that include a pivotal 1978\r\n      <i>First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti</i> decision allowing for corporations' ballot-initiative campaign contributions,\r\n      citing the First Amendment.\r\n      <sup>2</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      \r\n      The Result? The corporation, in \"person\" form, takes on Pseudo-Human qualities: immortal, beyond-measure capital, and programmatically\r\n      serving stock-holders' interests with cut-throat competition at all costs. No match against a sympathetic human,\r\n      yet the Corporation is given the same rights and privileges as the man in the street. Now, in the face of two decades'\r\n      dead humans--as young as\r\n      <i>Sandy Hook Elementary</i>, which were not protected by Legislation, due to commitments made to corporate lobbying.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>It appears increasingly difficult for Marco Rubio to accept money from gun lobbyists\r\n      <i>in exchange</i> for executing their legislation demands.

This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint.\r\n      For example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore's 49.8!</p>\r\n      <p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to\r\n      <i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking:\r\n      Denial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot),\r\n      so the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle. </p>\r\n      <p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly,\r\n      this is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950's (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating\r\n      system. </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      Next, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of \"fairness\" because blockchain transactions are\r\n      <i>\r\n        <strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i> Bitcoin transactions are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle,\r\n      which is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      Swirld's unveiled their consensus-based\r\n      <strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has now been announced to\r\n      deploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news! Tremendous, since I explained\r\n      in my\r\n      <a href=\"#18-03-01\">March 1st </a> blog post that older blockchain technologies incentivize miners' efforts by directly tying electrical-cost(\r\n      (in calculations) to the Bitcoin/hour profit margin. For this reason, the future horizon just considerably shortened\r\n      Bitcoin's runway for establishing anything beyond \"early-adopter\" status. </p>\r\n      <p>So, we'll see if the innovating crew with Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum can successfully alter the crypto algorithm\r\n      into it's planned carbon-free consensus-based, \"proof-of-stake\" form. For the moment, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other\r\n      electricity-draining \"proof-of-work\" designs, have their\r\n      <strong>exchange value trapped inside their own Carbon Footprint</strong>.\r\n      <sup>4</sup> And so, because environmental sustainablity is foremost of concerns for future investment, survival may\r\n      depend on digging out of that Carbon Footprint much more quickly!</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>1.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-thinks-it-can-one-up-bitcoin-and-ethereum-with-faster-transactions/#175e5c79abcb\">\r\n        https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-thinks-it-can-one-up-bitcoin-and-ethereum-with-faster-transactions/#175e5c79abcb\r\n      </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>2.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/hedera-hashgraph-swirlds-no-fork-guarantee-cryptocurrency-touts-resistance-code-splits/\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\">\r\n        https://www.coindesk.com/hedera-hashgraph-swirlds-no-fork-guarantee-cryptocurrency-touts-resistance-code-splits/</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>3.\r\n      <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-and-mz-unveil-next-generation-blockchain-alternative/\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\">\r\n        https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/13/hedera-hashgraph-and-mz-unveil-next-generation-blockchain-alternative/</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      <p>4.\r\n      <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div class=\"mar 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-03-12\">\r\n      <hr />\r\n      <button>\r\n      <a href=\"#martop\">Top</a>\r\n      </button>&nbsp;\r\n      <h4 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h4>\r\n      \r\n      <h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"chapternumber\">March 12, 2018</h6>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:\r\n      <br /> Part II and New Forms of Trust</h6>\r\n      <p class=\"firstparagraph\">\r\n      Throughout the centralized-tech period of the\r\n      <i>mobile-powered </i> Web 2.0, most Sharing transactions take place on a centralized platform that simply facilitates\r\n      the peer-to-peer transactions. However, the trust is based on some third-party authority. For instance, Uber serves\r\n      as the centralalized, third-party authority between both consumers (whether resource-obtaining or resource-providing)\r\n      must place their trust. Similarly, centralized authorities like Paypal, etc. enable peer-to-peer collaboration.\r\n      Yet, the notion of trust remains unsolved: Both parties must place their faith in the third party. By definition,\r\n      this problem that undermines the\r\n      <i>Sharing Economy</i> is resolved by Blockchain technologies, through cryptography. Now, Decentralized Apps (DAPPS)\r\n      provide a truer sharing platform for value transactions.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>In short, neither peer,\r\n      <strong>neither consumer needs to be trusted, because both parties share a mutual trust in their shared ledger</strong>\r\n      (think of a thick book with an indexed log of each and every transaction, with unchangeable entries etched by cryptography.\r\n      In this fashion the forms of Exchange Value include:\r\n      <br /> 1.

Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer\r\n      marketplaces,\r\n      <i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer\r\n      of resources. By either sense, the\r\n      <i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media,\r\n      internet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s\r\n      <i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods\r\n      and services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>In\r\n      <i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how\r\n      the\r\n      <strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>.\r\n      <sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3) breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general\r\n      purpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power,\r\n      sources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>The first condition: New forms of communication to\r\n      <i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second\r\n      condition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition:\r\n      New methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving\r\n      solar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated,\r\n      driverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new\r\n      technology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s\r\n      innovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in\r\n      the present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively\r\n      the New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>So, how can we change the way we\r\n      <i>think</i> and how we\r\n      <i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on\r\n      <strong>\r\n        <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i>\r\n      </strong>\r\n      <sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will\r\n      a New Paradigm Shift emerge. In this occasion however, we as a society may not have the luxury of decades to adapt\r\n      to New Technologies, as the carbon hangover from the previous Industrial Era imperils the safe arrival of the next!</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>1.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>2.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/node/21553017\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.economist.com/node/21553017</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>3.\r\n      <a href=\"https://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\">3.

This means that every institution, whether private hospitals, non-profit charity\r\n      foundations, or government bureaus, will effectively restructure (optimize) their own organizational structure in\r\n      an increasingly\r\n      <i>data-driven</i> paradigm. From a Sociology of Organizations perspective, the changes to come are breath-taking to\r\n      consider.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>So why women? Where could I start? Better stated, why is a quintessentially important job sector, a sector in desperate\r\n      need for insight, comprised primarily of men?\r\n      <sup id=\"one\">1</sup> The facts are evident: ~15-20% of women comprising tech positions.\r\n      <sup id=\"two\">2</sup> Numbers aside, I argue there is a quintessential societal need for more women in tech: This is because computing\r\n      and understanding data has changed since the data collection from Web 2.0 (mobile), becoming more networked and\r\n      relational.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>The challenge for society in this age is historic, and women must absolutely be included in the process of the age:\r\n      Please consider, that in the 1650&#39;s, the invention of the microscope opened a new world of data and\r\n      <i>information</i> about the bacteriological, microscopic surroundings--hitherto blind to all. Likewise, the telescope\r\n      has allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage)\r\n      a universe of knowledge--about\r\n      <i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the\r\n      data to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the\r\n      <i>output</i> can be\r\n      <i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the\r\n      key challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables. This is akin\r\n      to finding a needle in an increasingly complex and growing haystack.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"quote\">What&#39;s different now and has changed is it&#39;s no longer about taking this data, putting it into a computer\r\n      running a calculation and getting a balance sheet answer ...</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"quote\">What&#39;s important now is what is the context of the data, what is it connected to, what effect is it having on\r\n      data around it...

Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era\r\n      <sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any\r\n      medical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39;\r\n      surface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively,\r\n      and provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics\r\n      are\r\n      <i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"quote\">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating\r\n      strains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies\r\n      relied on a misleading methodology.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"quote\">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations\r\n      in the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which\r\n      manufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while\r\n      it is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains.\r\n      <sup>1</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu\r\n      virus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu\r\n      <i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with\r\n      <i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"quote\">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses\r\n      that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that\r\n      are pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic\r\n      tree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system\r\n      exposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond\r\n      <sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular\r\n      period each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal\r\n      time-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"quote\">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further\r\n      away on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses.\r\n      <sup>2</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a\r\n      <i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also\r\n      provides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain\r\n      math can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort\r\n      of.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each\r\n      other, then conditional upon other factors. This being\r\n      <i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e\r\n      things: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any\r\n      <i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions\r\n      about a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our\r\n      sciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The\r\n      first of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of\r\n      which gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>\r\n      The third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating\r\n      <i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better\r\n      handle on the multiple effects of\r\n      <sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large\r\n      Numbers\r\n      <sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new\r\n      <strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the\r\n      <i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician\r\n      out there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!\r\n      \r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>1.\r\n      <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>2.\r\n      <a href=\"https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual\" target=\"_blank\"> https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>3.\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"quote\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div class=\"mar 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-03-03\">\r\n      <hr />\r\n      <button>\r\n      <a href=\"#martop\">Top</a>\r\n      </button>&nbsp;\r\n      <h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\r\n      \r\n      <h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Sociology Tomorrow!</h5>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"chapternumber\">March 3-4, 2018\r\n      <br /> Weekend\r\n      </h6>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"dailytitle chapternumber\">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel</h6>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"firstparagraph\">Back in 1997, a Pulitzer-Prize winning theory--based on Dr. Jared Diamond&#39;s\r\n      <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies</i> --provided the recipe book for the success of societies.\r\n      Not without controversy, the theory posits that geographic and environmental preconditions, once met, provide tech\r\n      &amp; resources trading opportunities, within a network of other nation-states also vying for technogical innovation.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>A nation&#39;s Technology, in turn, opens the means necessary to expansive, stable, independent sovereignty that\r\n      lasts and thrives.

While excessive ads were one reason\r\n      for the heat generation, the main cause was that the phone&#39;s CPU was hijacked to mine for Monero.\r\n      <sup>1</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>The larger issue here is that the lines between trusted mobile-app authorities, i.e., certified by Play Store or\r\n      Apple&#39;s is increasingly irrelevent. This is because an increasing number of app-users are ditching device-downloaded\r\n      apps, preferring for browser applications--hence, a much more appetizing market for the newest generation of blackhat\r\n      hackers, online thieves, peeping-toms, and other ill-wishers. There are a few driving factors for this issue--one\r\n      of which is the onset of Decentralized Applications (DAPPs), which use the\r\n      <i>browser</i> to interface between the Every-Day blockchain client/merchant/programmer and the actual byte-code of\r\n      the blockchain (via WEB).</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>More importantly, the larger issue is that we live in an age in which the exclusive, native browser language since\r\n      1995, i.e. JavaScript. Security issues with browser-based apps were very low, because JavaScript never left the\r\n      browser, ever. Until 2009, Data, Servers were the domain of PHP, JAVA, Python, etc. or some other language for the\r\n      highly sensitive, dirty work of dipping into all that data sitting ontop of centralized servers around the world.\r\n      PHP wasn&#39;t easy, so power and responsibility usually followed with all the extra effort and expertise.</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>2015 augured in the Node.js server-accessing (can create, read, update, and delete date) new-born capabilities of\r\n      JavaScript</p>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      <p>1.\r\n      <a href=\"\r\n      https://www.coindesk.com/opera-browser-introduces-cryptocurrency-miner-protection-for-smartphones/\r\n      \" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.coindesk.com/opera-browser-introduces-cryptocurrency-miner-protection-for-smartphones/ </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div class=\"mar 18-03 -12\" id=\"18-03-01\">\r\n      <hr />\r\n      <button>\r\n      <a href=\"#martop\">Top</a>\r\n      </button>&nbsp;\r\n      <h5 class=\"title dailytech longtitle\">OUR DAILY TECH:</h5>\r\n      \r\n      <h5 class=\"subdailytech\">Musing Blockchain</h5>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"author\">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"chapternumber\">March 1, 2018</h6>\r\n      \r\n      <h6 class=\"chapternumber dailytitle\">Blockchain Sustainability Issues and The Double-Edged Sword</h6>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"firstparagraph\">I couldn&#39;t help but revisit the\r\n      <strong>Environmental Sustainability</strong> problem I addressed in my February 28th post. This problem, experienced by\r\n      the top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the\r\n      <i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the\r\n      <i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity KiloWatt Hours\r\n      per year.\r\n      <sup>1</sup> Digiconomist succinctly writes:</p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"quote\">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a\r\n      solid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years\r\n      this has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of\r\n      the currency reached new highs.\r\n      <sup>2</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>And, so the issue I&#39;m addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more\r\n      equipment, and in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin&#39;s surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year\r\n      usage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per year, respectively.\r\n      In other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner&#39;s cost (in electricity) compared with the miner&#39;s gain (in\r\n      Bitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper Carbon Footprint.</p>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"quote\">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin network has\r\n      been increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start of November 2017, the Bitcoin\r\n      Energy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network to be half of the\r\n      current amount. On the first day of November, the estimated consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year.\r\n      <sup>1</sup>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>\r\n      Carbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner&#39;s electricity costs account for approximately\r\n      65% of the profit (Bitcoin units&#39; value, measured when mined). So the\r\n      <i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost\r\n      of the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the\r\n      <i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then\r\n      perhaps the other edge looks preferred!\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>1.\r\n      <a href=\"\r\n      https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\r\n      \" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>2.\r\n      <a href=\"\r\n      https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\r\n      \" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <hr /><a href=\"#martop\">\r\n      <button id=\"end\">TOP</button>\r\n      </a>\r\n              `;\r\n              \r\n                  } else {\r\n              \r\n                    secretParagraphMAR.style.display = 'none';\r\n              \r\n                  }\r\n              \r\n              };\r\n              \r\n              \r\n              \n\n//# sourceURL=webpack:///./src/js/dom-loader.js?");
