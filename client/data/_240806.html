<p class="firstparagraph quote">The Ghosts of the Past have come again to steer my thoughts.  H&eacute;las! I cannot but acquiesce to them. After all, it was a dreary night, in the immediate aftermath(s) of the infamous <i>CloudStrike</i> bug that the misdirected accusations and misplaced assumptions abounded across the land. It was the voice of my ex-girlfriend, with whom I debated, that resoundedly defended Windows, because after all, CloudStrike (CS) <i>isn't a dependency</i>, a simple software. Blame it on the team, she said, blame it on the decision to install the software.. blame it on Delta. They should have chosen a better anti-virus like McAfee! To this notion I inserted my 2 cents that it was indeed a dependency of Windows. So it was both the fault of CS and how much more of Microsoft for allowing it. Further, the users of Windows servers were powerless to prevent the error. To resolve this enigmatic question, the reader and I must dive deep: </p>  <p > What really is the difference between the <span style="color:white;background-color:blue;" >stomach-curling Blue Screen and Linux's black screen of death, or rarer yet, Mac's Pink Screen of demise? Nothing, it just so happens the former happens. And happens alot more frequently. </span> But why you ask? Because of the irascible and increasingly unscrupulous bi-modal architecture of Windows itself. </p> <p> My story cannot complete itself without touching upon these details --that the strict line between kernel-mode (i.e. external apps, users, etc are forbidden, being relegated to user-mode.) So what takes place in kernel mode? Well those delicate activities and configurations that only Windows will certify with ample testing, like the thread scheduler (bear with this tangent, dear reader), heap manager, and perhaps a graphical functionality, for example, to access driver, which would talk to the GPU across the PCI Bus. <br/> So, where does CloudStrike's <i><span style="color:green">FALCON</span></i> fit into this picture? [Returning now to the point of whether or not this antimalware software Falcon is a dependency].</p> <p>Earlier antimalware not only looks at files, but also the behavior of the operating itself; hence the need access the kernel ... thus passing beyond the line of kernel mode -- a necessary evil you say? yes, a necessary risk. However, it used to be that modifcations of the this device driver (i.e. not hardware, just CloudStrike's Falcon software; any software alterations MUST therefore pass any tests, proffered by Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL), which at the end of such battery of tests, is <i>signed &amp; certified by Windows.</i>) Thus, the necessary evil-risk is indeed mitigated; and all remain happy, without any case of the blues. <br /> Sadly, though, times change and standards stoop ever lower -- because it is 2024, and the once-lofty WHQL no longer requires alterations to such drivers as Falcon to pass the battery of tests because of the advent of <i>now-programmable</i> "dynamic definition files" (which now re-program the behavior of the driver itself! ...thereby circumventing the once-strict line of defense that guarded the sacred Kernel Mode from harm.</p> <p>And so, my short tangent is completed, now that we know that this dangerous software can enter and exit kernel mode access at will -- The case STILL justifies Windows and CloudStrike because the User/Enterprise is still at fault for using this so-called non-dependency, correct? Wrong. Windows has allowed CloudStrike (in a bid to embed its software into the OS) to mark their driver as a "Boot-Start Driver"--id est, a driver for a device that <strong>must</strong> be installed to start the MS Windows Operating System.  Huh?!? Yep. Whereas most boot-start drivers are included in driver packages that are "in-the-box" with Windows, Windows automatically installs these boot-start drivers during first boot of the system. If a boot-start driver for a device is not included in a driver package that is "in-the-box" with Windows, a user can install an additional vendor-supplied driver package for the device; And in these instances, let's say on a Saturday afternoon when cleaning out the home computer, refreshing, and reinstalling software, these driver packages <i>should</i> be added to the image <u>offline</u> before the image is deployed to a system. Simple. And Safe. Right? <br /> Wrong. CrowdStrike did not want you booting Windows without their precious software! So instead you must reboot Windows in Safe Mode, to remove or uninstall this surreptitious piece of software.  And so, there you have it, in 1,000 words or less, this Spectre of the Past has been exposed, and the public can now act as Judge and Jury to lay all the blame on both Windows lax security policy and CloudStrike's ineptitude to not even test for null-pointer errors (the absolute simplest errors and simplest to test/protect against), while justifying and restoring innocence to the many clients, user or enterprise alike, who were left powerless to the impending doom that CloudStrike Falcon would shrowd the world--if only for a a weekend. So next time there is a Ghost in the Shell, we can learn to undermine and root out the perils that lay beneath!</p>
