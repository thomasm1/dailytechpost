      <h1>Sherlock Holmes</h1>
      <p class="firstp">"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you
        not come at once?"</p>
        <p class="secondp">"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to <a href="#">Major
          Prendergast</a> about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
          you."</p>
          <p class="thirdp"><img src="180-180.png" class="dog-pic">"It is really two days since you had the letter. <span class="span1">We should have
            acted before this.</span> You have no further evidence, I suppose, than
            that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which
            might help us?"</p>
            <p class="fourthp">"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
              pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted
              paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance,"
              said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I
              observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the
              ashes were of this particular colour.</p>
              <p>I found this single sheet
                upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it
                may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from
                among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction.</p>
                <p>Beyond
                the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think
                myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is
                undoubtedly my uncle's."</p>
                <p>Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,
                  which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
                  a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the
                  following enigmatical notices:</p>
                  <ul class="notices">
                    <li>4th. Hudson came. Same old platform</li>
                    <li>9th. McCauley cleared</li>
                    <li>10th. John Swain cleared</li>
                    <li>12th. Visited Paramore. All well</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it
                    to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another
                    instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
                    me. You must get home instantly and act."</p>
                    <p>"What shall I do?"</p>
                    <p>"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must
                      put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
                      box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say
                      that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that
                      this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such
                      words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you
                      must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do
                      you understand?"</p>
