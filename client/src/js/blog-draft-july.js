 <p class="firstparagraph">It turns out that data is unevenly distributed between sectors:</p>
  <p class="quote">A persistent challenge for Element is the dearth of good data. The simplest way to train A.I. models is to feed them lots of well-labeled examples—thousands of cat images, or translated texts. Big Tech has access to so much consumer-oriented data that it’s all but impossible for anyone else to compete at building large-scale consumer products. But businesses, governments, and other institutions own huge amounts of private information. Even if a corporation uses Google for email, or Amazon for cloud computing, it doesn’t typically let those vendors access its internal databases about equipment malfunctions, or sales trends, or processing times. <br />
  <br />That’s where Element sees an opening. If it can access several companies’ databases of, say, product images, it can then—with customers’ permission—use all of that information to build a better product-recommendation engine. Big Tech companies are also selling A.I. products and services to businesses—IBM is squarely focused on it—but no one has cornered the market. Element’s bet is that if it can embed itself in these organizations, it can secure a corporate data advantage similar to the one Big Tech has in consumer products.<sup>1.</sup></p>

  <p class="quote">In the Modern Field of Artiificial Intelligence, all roads seem to lead to three researchers with ties to Canadian universities. The first, Geoffrey Hinton, a 70-year-old Brit who teaches at the University of Toronto, pioneered the subfield called deep learning that has become synonymous with A.I. The second, a 57-year-old Frenchman named Yann LeCun, worked in Hinton’s lab in the 1980s and now teaches at New York University. The third, 54-year-old Yoshua Bengio, was born in Paris, raised in Montreal, and now teaches at the University of Montreal. The three men are close friends and collaborators, so much so that people in the A.I. community call them the Canadian Mafia.<sup>1.</sup></p>

  <p class="firstparagraph">A curious path of punctuated advancement due to insufficient memory and cpu power, characterized late 20th century A.I. development. For a period of ten years, then the GPU,  each step of Deep Learning development has been marked by long lulls interrupted by rapid growth with each successive technological tools: Dr. Geoff Hinton's single-layered A.I. algorithm gained brief fame, to lose all interest for ten years, and A.I. research no longer advanced due to insufficient memory and cpu power--for a period of ten years, then along came the GPU.  And then Alex Khreshinski's famous image-recognition competition-winning penmanship detector, which notably is still in use by the banking system. Also known as the "Cambrian Explosion", this event (and really just the algorithm) set off widespread advancements and speciation from the ANN, Neural Network, to a whole alphabet soup from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) <i>to far-reaching mutations of Reinforcement Learning</i>.<sup>2</sup>
  </p>
 
  <p> Along with Hinton's close collaborator throughout the 1980's and 90's, Dr. Yoshua Bengio of the University of Montr&eacute;al, the researchers remain committed to humanity's service:</p>
   
  <p class="quote">
  Hinton moved from the U.S. to Canada in part due to disillusionment with Reagan-era politics and disapproval of military funding of artificial intelligence.[22] He believes political systems will use AI to "terrorize people". Hinton has petitioned against lethal autonomous weapons. Regarding existential risk from artificial intelligence, Hinton has stated that superintelligence seems more than 50 years away, but warns that "there is not a good track record of less intelligent things controlling things of greater intelligence". Asked in 2015 why he continues research despite his grave concerns, Hinton stated "I could give you the usual arguments. But the truth is that the prospect of discovery is too sweet." Hinton has also stated that "It is very hard to predict beyond five years" what advances AI will bring.<sup>1</sup></p>
  <p>While Hinton and company aren't necessarily Mahatma Gandhi-like, their devotion to a science prioritized to humanity' service--free from monetary or other influence is admirable--no wonder their outlook on A.I.'s utility is so much brighter than that of Pessimist Elon Musk and company ... baah-humbug!

  <p class="firstparagraph">Already A.I. has shown its true colors as an ideal tool for solving disproportionately large, complex data problems: Similar to Watson's medical recommendations based on millions of pages read, the off-the scale amount of pages from every tech company is the item of interest. This is the flurry-to-snowstorm of Privacy Policies simultaneously released in response to the E.U.'s May 25th General Data Protection Regulations.  In reference to my June 30th post on A.I. workplace solutions, months of busy-reading-work all distilled to a fraction of the time to analyze those policies. Guess what? The rule-breaking is well under way!</p>
  <p class="quote">Researchers from the European Union Institute in Florence worked with an EU consumer organization to create the software. They then used the program to examine the privacy policies of 14 major technology businesses, including by Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc.<br /><br />
 
  They found that a third of those clauses were "potentially problematic" or contained "insufficient information." Another 11 percent of the policy’s sentences used unclear language, the academics said.  The researchers didn’t make public which companies’ policies violated which provisions of the law, publishing only aggregate findings for all of the companies in the study.</p>
 
  <p>Aha! <i>The practices of Tech companies' use of A.I. to analyze customers' private data is well-known, but <strong>what do we actually know</strong> beyond just that? Behind the veil of commercial secret, much less is known than is led on ... until now. Now, A.I. becomes increasingly useful as a tattle-tale! </i> So by the same token that tech creates problems, Tech is the first to provide a solution. But A.I. rule-checking sounds good but raises another question: Who owns, or can access by alternate means, the personal data we have strewn across the internet? And what quality of data does each party have, or shares?  </p>

<p class="quote"><i>Power is “various forms of domination and subordination and the asymmetrical balance of forces which operate whenever and wherever social relations exist.”  </i><sup>1</sup><br /><br />--Michel Foucault</p>
<p class="firstparagraph">Ties and balances of power, at their fundamental core are constantly changing variations of symmetry between two agents, whether unilateral or bilateral: Two nodes interlinked. Magnified by overlapping networks and layers of relations, it's easy to see why long-standing institutions are interlocked, for better or worse ... Clearly the trend of turbulence and power grabs reaches far and wide:
 </p>
<p class="quote">Poland was once a beacon for countries struggling to escape the yoke of the Soviet Union and embrace Western democracy. But it is now in league with neighboring nations, like Hungary, whose leaders have turned to authoritarian means to tighten their grip on power, presenting a grave challenge to a European Union already grappling with nationalist, populist and anti-immigrant movements.<br /><br />

The forced retirements of up to 27 of 72 Supreme Court justices, including the top judge, and the creation of a judicial disciplinary chamber were the latest in a series of steps by Poland’s right-wing Law and Justice Party to take over the justice system.
</p>
<p>As it always is in film, it is so now that dire situations have to call upon the true Super Man, Technology, to save the day: And what form this time? Blockchain technology, which presents a cryptographic solution to the problem of trust:<i> If two agents can agree on a third cryptographic intermediary, then a bridge of trust is built--the kind that in the past only institutions could broker!</i>. </p>
<p>And so, two humans devise a new means to exchange without disruption--an indestructable scaffolding firmly set in the foreground from today's creaking and swaying institutions. Sounds good, but where's the music? There seems to be a subtle interlude between the honeymoon stage of investing and inventing new currencies, and little in the way of micro-transactions and <i> the actual <strong>using</strong> it</i>. It takes a little trust to make trust, so the effort is on to make a bridge from the <i>early adopters</i> stage to <i>mainstream adoption</i>...<sup>3</sup>

<p class="quote">A vast majority of the half-million bodies in the inner asteroid belt may in fact be shrapnel from as few as five parent bodies called "planetesimals," scientists say. But the tangled orbits of those lost worlds meant they were doomed to collide, producing fragments that also collided, producing still more fragments in a cataclysmic cascade that's been going on for more than 4 billion years.<sup>1</sup></p><p>
