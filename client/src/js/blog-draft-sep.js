  <p class="quote">This year, the ban on motorized traffic will apply to the whole of Paris, except for the Bois (woods) and the périphérique (inner ring road). 
  The Parisians themselves will not be able to drive their own vehicle, including electric vehicles, 'clean' energy vehicles, and Autolib vehicles.<br /><br />
  
  The following vehicles will be allowed to circulate, at a maximum of 30 km/h: non-motorized vehicles, emergency vehicles, vehicles for disabled people, taxis, public transport, BigBus and Open Tour, and VTC (the latter (private hire taxis) were not allowed to circulate last year). There are also numerous alternative modes of transport - bicycle, horse & carriage, cyclopolitain (pedicabs) … <sup>1</sup>

  <br /><br />
    But the city is in the midst of a metamorphosis. With fewer, yet stronger storms on the horizon, it’s begun an ambitious plan to cut its reliance on imported water in half by 2025. And it’s emerging as a leader in the frantic international quest to curb emissions—in 2016 alone, it slashed emissions by 11 percent, the equivalent of taking more than 700,000 cars off the road.
    <br /><br />
    We generated 30,000 new green jobs since I've been mayor, so in five years. To put that in perspective, there's 50,000 coal jobs left in America. So this town that’s just 1 percent, roughly, of the US population has created the equivalent of 60 percent of the remaining coal jobs left in America. Appalachia should be doing that, areas that have been hard hit by a recession and not recovered. These are generally good middle class jobs too, not just minimum wage.<sup>1</sup>

  Invisible upgrades are the true talking points of new mobile device  releases as they hint big things under the hood... Last year's iPhone X may have been alot of hardware show (with the X/8/8plus providing the first A.I.-dedicated chip), but 2018 augurs big things ahead and bigger muscle:
  <p class="quote">
  On Wednesday Apple announced that the neural engine is now significantly more powerful. Last year’s debut model could crank through 600 billion operations per second. The new version can work almost 10 times faster, reaching 5 trillion operations per second. Some of that speedup may come from using smaller transistors inside the A12, with features as small as 7 nanometers.<sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>So, just as Apple tends to future-proof its technology, this year's release does not disappoint the constellation of iOS developers that can take advantage of the tech, with  better battery efficiency ...</p>
  <p class="quote">App developers can play with the power of Apple’s new neural engine through Core ML, a framework the company offers to help programmers deploy machine learning on Apple devices. The company says that this allows developers to run machine learning code nine times faster than on the iPhone X, while using a tenth of the energy.<sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>Thanks to Apple's commitment to A.I., the iPhone Xs,   Xs Max, and   Xr offer all the joys of smart video/camera, processing, augmented reality, --<i>and with battery <strong>savings?</strong>   Ooh L&aacute; L&aacute;!</i>

  <p class="firstparagraph">Vitalik Buterin, architect of Ethereum crypto-contract/currency, presented at the recent TechCrunch Disrupt! conference with no shortage of opinions on the direction of blockchain and crypto-currency/contract investments... This, after the Ethereum (WEI) declines nearly ten-fold along with Bitcoin's 70% drop<sup>1</sup>, along with other major crypto-currencies. </p>
  <p>The story is less dramatic and mysterious than it is simply the natural course of market novelties' <i>transition from Early Adapters to General Acceptance</i>: The underlying value transitions from increasing public awareness to mainstream acceptance, which requires new, ensuing <i>expectations that differ from the previous period</i>. The substance of perceived value dictates actual value. Buterin opines to Bloomberg News...
    <p class="quote"> 
     The blockchain space is getting to the point where there’s a ceiling in sight. If you talk to the average educated person at this point, they probably have heard of blockchain at least once. There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore ... Growth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the blockchain community through its first six or seven years was dependent on marketing and trying to get wider adoption. <br /><br /> 
That strategy is getting close to hitting a dead end.  The next step will be getting people who are already interested in cryptocurrencies to be involved in a more in-depth way. "Go from just people being interested to real applications of real economic activity" [Buterin] said.  <sup>2</sup></p> 
    <img src="dist/img/diffusion.jpg" class="zoom" />
    <p>So, the old expectations generated a very low bar to prove actual utility, whereas present-day collective knowledge demands clearer practical proof; inherently the bar is raised. And now, by technical sweat of the brow, crypto-based fintech now faces the realities of what will be needed for wide-spread use: technical solutions to scalability problems, security issues, and of course speed, availability and consistency of data transfer. Yet, now more importantly, ease-of-mainstream-use. </p>
    <p>For example, Ethereum contract writers must learn a new language, Solidity; and Ethereum currency holders must grapple with browser-to-ledger interfaces like MetaMask, which are far from intuitive for even the most enthusiastic of early adopters!  </p>
    <p> This concept is laid bare in sociological terms, citing Rogers and Shumacher's 1971 article from my Feb. 15 post: the general sociological Early Adopter theory--based on Everett M. Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory, describing the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle as fairly ordinary, or better stated, fairly historical--again repeating itself.<sup>3</sup> </p>

Crypto-currencies in all forms have sustained a 9-month decline, which most could not have anticipated.  Take for instance, December 2017's $1500 Ether value to recent values of $185<sup>1</sup>, and Bitcoin's November 2017 valuation of just under $20,000 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) down to this week's $6,400.  </p>
     
     <img src="dist/img/cryptocurrency.jpg" class="zoom" />
     <p>The theories are multi-fold:</p>
     <p class="quote">Some have posited that blockchain and cryptocurrency projects might be converting their ether reserves into fiat currencies to meet financial obligations. At face value, this appears plausible, as startups incur many expenses during their growth phase. If a collection of companies liquidated the cryptocurrencies—mostly ether—that they raised in ICOs at the same time, they could exert downward pressure on prices.<sup>2</sup></p>
       <p>Others blame investment psychology ... </p> 
       <p class="quote">It’s possible that the price decline reflects a negative feedback loop, a combination of economics and psychology. As crypto investors sell their holdings, they see that prices are falling. This could spook them into selling even more. This is somewhat like a bank run, except investors lose faith in the value of cryptocurrencies rather than the viability of a financial institution.<sup>2</sup>
       </p>
       <p>Others still, they blame ease-of-use and accesibility ... </p>
       <p class="quote">Cryptocurrency investors (and especially ethereum backers) may be disappointed (paywall) by the low usage of decentralized applications (dapps) like IDEX, Bancor, and CryptoKitties. These apps run on crypto tokens, and thus generate demand for the assets.
<br /><br />
       But when investors visit a cryptocurrency exchange, they aren’t presented with information about the daily active users on various dapps. They’re generally only presented with the price of an asset and a chart of its history.<sup>2</sup>
       </p>
       <p>However one distributes the blame, psychological and economic explanations only fail where sociological explanations offer coherent explanations ... Look no further than my September 10th post ...

     <p class="firstparagraph">Quantum solutions to computing needs become clearer, and specific uses for research come to light. First and foremost, quantum mechanics offer a realm of solutions that has ever eluded modern science: problem-solving algorithms that face orders of complexity of 40 to 50 orders of magnitude, i.e. Complexity<sup>50</sup> is just a tad too complex for the fast, but straight-line dumb A.I.-based solutions, which are inherent to classificatory machine-learning schema. Blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graphs are less helpful, but find their utility in the unescapably fast ability to <i>share data where data is needed</i><br /><br /></p>
     Manipulations of the quantum realm are not at all intuitive to concepts we learn from the classical world. Less intuitive are the constraints of the data analysis. For example, the quantum metaphor of flipping two coins simultaneously means knowing the "state" of one coin if you know the other coin's state. The one lands on heads, and because it shares an entangled state with the other, <i>you are guaranteed to know the outcome of the second coin</i>. </p>

     <p>Image credit: TechCrunch Disrupt! Day 3</p>
     <p>Superconducting devices offer powerful tooling, yet <i>the catch is that the time you have to run calculations is approximately 50 micro-seconds</i>, i.e. the <strong>coherence time of entangled, superposed state</strong>. (a marked improvement from 1990's hardware that yielded coherence time of 1 nano-second). Not exactly enough time to run a long program, especially if you consider just one small algorithm is a series of logical gates that depend sequentially on other logical gates..., let alone an actual program. So then what's the use? The specific uses in academic research are without limit for those problems that present specific, exponential complexity--many cases in biotech, chemistry, and so on. Quantum computing offers a 'burst' of calculations, and nothing more, at least for now. </p>

     <p>Not to be underestimated, quantum calculations operate best when modeling the laws of nature--because nature obeys quantum mechanical rules, beginning with chemistry. After all, quantum analysis simulated the largest molecule last year--and that's no small matter!  </p>

After all, they are the solid, predictable workhorse for transporting web surfers' requests and web servers' responses.

  <p class="quote">Chrome looks ahead to its next 10 years, the team is mulling its most controversial initiative yet: fundamentally rethinking URLs across the web.
<br /><br />
  Uniform Resource Locators are the familiar web addresses you use every day. They are listed in the web's DNS address book and direct browsers to the right Internet Protocol addresses that identify and differentiate web servers. <br /><br />
  As web functionality has expanded, URLs have increasingly become unintelligible strings of gibberish combining components from third-parties or being masked by link shorteners and redirect schemes. And on mobile devices there isn't room to display much of a URL at all.  The resulting opacity has been a boon for cyber criminals who build malicious sites to exploit the confusion.
  <br /><br />
  The focus right now, they say, is on identifying all the ways people use URLs to try to find an alternative that will enhance security and identity integrity on the web while also adding convenience for everyday tasks like sharing links on mobile devices.<sup>1</sup></p>
