  <p class="firstparagraph">Vitalik Buterin, architect of Ethereum crypto-contract/currency, presented at the recent TechCrunch Disrupt! conference with no shortage of opinions on the direction of blockchain and crypto-currency/contract investments horizon... This, after the the Ethereum currency continues to decline, along with Bitcoin and other major currencies. Take for instance, December 2017's $1500 Ether value to recent values of $185<sup>1</sup>, and Bitcoin's November 2017 valuation of just under $20,000 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) down to this week's $6400.  </p>
  <p>The story is less dramatic and mysterious than it is simply the natural course of market novelties' <i>transition from Early Adapters to General Acceptance</i>: The underlying value transitions from increasing public awareness to mainstream acceptance and the new, ensuing expectations that differ from the previous period. The substance of perceived value dictates actual value. Buterin opines to Bloomberg News...
    <p class="quote"> 
     The blockchain space is getting to the point where there’s a ceiling in sight. If you talk to the average educated person at this point, they probably have heard of blockchain at least once. There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore ... Growth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the blockchain community through its first six or seven years was dependent on marketing and trying to get wider adoption. <br /><br />
     Growth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the blockchain community through its first six or seven years was dependent on marketing and trying to get wider adoption.
That strategy is getting close to hitting a dead end.  The next step will be getting people who are already interested in cryptocurrencies to be involved in a more in-depth way, Buterin said. “Go from just people being interested to real applications of real economic activity [Buterin] said.

    <p>So, the old expectations generated a very low bar to prove actual utility, whereas present-day collective knowledge demands clearer proof of utility; inherently the bar is raised. And now, by technical sweat of the brow faces the realities of what will be needed for wide-spread use: technical solutions to scalability problems, security issues, ease-of-mainstream-use, and of course speed, availability and consistency of data transfer.</p>
    <p>This concept is laid bare in sociological terms, citing Rogers and Shumacher's 1971 article from my Feb. 15 post: the general sociological Early Adopter theory--based on Everett M. Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory, describing the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle as fairly ordinary, or better stated, fairly historical--again repeating itself.<sup>3</sup>

     <p class="firstparagraph">Quantum solutions to computing needs become clearer, and specific uses for research come to light. First and foremost, quantum mechanics offers a realm of solutions that has ever eluded modern science: problem-solving algorithms that face orders of complexity that exceed 40 to 50 orders of magnitude, i.e. Complexity<sup>50</sup> is just a tad too complex for the fast, but straight-line dumb A.I.-based solutions, which are inherent to classificatory schema.

But the most widespread problem is that of non-A.I., non-machine-learning that masquerade as A.I., but are only complex looping algorithms. Much ado about nothing has been the death-knell for more than a few of the Startup Battlefield's contenders. <i>Disrupt's merciless premises abruptly dashed dreams, but I guess that's what a public and publicized forum for Peer Review is all about!<br /> <br />... to be continued. </p>
