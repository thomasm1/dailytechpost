    blogpost7 =  `<p class="firstparagraph">Predictive analytics  has slowly progressed in sophistication over the past 45 years, and the current nexus with powerful machine-learning tools changes the health game: </p>
    <p class="quote"> A report by ABI Research June 2018 report highlighted a significant rise in patient monitoring devices, including AI for home-based preventative healthcare and predictive analytics, which could save hospitals around $52bn by 2021.<br /><br />

    Accenture’s Digital Health Technology Vision 2018 report also claims that 85% of health executives in the US believe that every human will be directly impacted on a daily basis by an AI-based decision within the next three years.<br /><br />
    
    Utilising big data generated by clinical information and research can reveal clusters and patterns which can benefit all aspects of healthcare, leading patient care to become increasingly strategic.<sup>1</sup>  </p>
    <p>It should be noted that the long road paved by statistical theory has revolutionized the above-mentioned fields as much as it now powers the practical use of analytics:</p>
    <p class="quote">Originating in the statistical (e.g., Holland
      1986; Rosenbaum 2002; Rubin 2005, 2006) and
      econometrics literature (see Heckman 2000,
      2001, 2005; Heckman & Vytlacil 2007a,b;
      Manski 1995, 2007), the counterfactual,
      Rubin, or potential outcomes model of causality
      has, over the past three decades, become
      the standard conceptual tool to unify the notion
      of causality, to understand the identification
      problem at the heart of causal inference,
      and to assess the utility of alternative estimation
      techniques (Sobel 2005).<sup>2</sup></p>
      <p>So, the take-away here is that A.I. and <i>Machine-Learning Research could have never progressed so quickly if not for the settled scientic paradigm over sound analysis that rules out spurious variables, while properly weighting the conditions that matter.</i> Furthermore, the mistakes in algorithm design were made in the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's--misleading mistakes--have been swept aside, providing much-tested and refined strategies. The medical field's case exemplifies this evolution:</p>
    <p class="quote">Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold
    standard for assessing the efficacy of medications, medical
    procedures, or clinical strategies. Nevertheless, particularly
    for research on the prevention of chronic disease, randomized
    trials are often infeasible because of their size, time,
    and budget requirements, as well as questionable generalizability
    or ethical constraints.<br /><br />
    On the other hand, nonexperimental studies of interventions
    have frequently been criticized because of their potential
    for selection bias. This concern reached a crescendo
    with the disparity in estimated effects of hormone replacement
    therapy from randomized trials and nonexperimental
    studies. This imbroglio highlighted the need to develop
    and apply improved methods to reduce bias in nonexperimental
    studies in which selection bias or confounding is
    likely to occur .<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p>So, nowadays we don't ask for a second opinion when we can ask for a trillion opinions narrowed down to one heck of a second opinion!</p>`;

Intel's advances pale in comparison, however, to GPU and newer computing trends. This theme arises time after time in my posts, but mathematics will rewrite the rules of performance . . .</p>
    <p class="quote">The 8th Gen processors incorporate Intel Octane memory, a smart and adaptable system accelerator for desktop and mobile platforms using SATA-based storage technology.<br /><br />

    Intel also has released a new Data Drive Acceleration feature that boosts a large secondary HDD hard drive.
    
    Together, Intel Octane and Data Drive Acceleration provide up to 4.7x the game loading speed and 1.7x faster media loading, Intel said.

    The actual task of processing AI is a very different process from standard computing or GPU processing, hence the perceived need for specialized chips. A x86 CPU can do AI, but it does a task in 12 steps when only three are required; a GPU in some cases can also be overkill.
    <br /><br />
    Generally, scientific computation is done in a deterministic fashion. You want to know two plus three equals five and calculate it to all of its decimal places—x86 and GPU do that just fine. But the nature of AI is to say 2.5 + 3.5 is observed to be six almost all of the time without actually running the calculation. What matters with artificial intelligence today is the pattern found in the data, not the deterministic calculation. 
    <br /><br />
The result of this predictive problem solving is that AI calculations can be done with single precision calculations. So while CPUs and GPUs can both do it very well, they are in fact overkill for the task. A single-precision chip can do the work and do it in a much smaller, lower power footprint.</p>

<p class="quote">Intel "can deliver on CPU functionality, which has dropped in performance, but still lags on GPUs and modems," noted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group.

"Much of the performance these days is gated by the modem and the GPU, not the CPU, which just isn't as importance as it once was," he told TechNewsWorld.

Developers may not benefit much from the new processors, Enderle said, because "with IDF shut down, Intel's developer efforts are largely moot."

    <p class="quote">Fintech broke onto the scene as a disruptive force following the 2008 crisis, but the industry's influence on the broader financial services system is changing.
  
    The fintech industry no longer stands clearly apart from financial services proper, and is increasingly growing embedded in mainstream finance. We're now seeing the initial stages of this transformation.<br /><br />
    
    For instance, funding is growing more internationally distributed, and startups are making necessary adjustments to prove sustainability and secure a seat at the table. Most fintech segments in the ascendant a year ago have continued to rise and grow more valuable to the broader financial system. Meanwhile, several fintech categories have had to make adjustments to stay on top. New subsegments are also appearing on the scene — such as digital identity verification fintechs — as new opportunities for innovation are discovered. 
    <br /><br /> ... 
    The rising influence of fintechs is having a dramatic effect on incumbents, from banks to insurers to wealth managers, pushing them to respond proactively to stay relevant. Incumbents are reacting to changes wrought by fintechs on three key fronts: the front end, the back end, and in their core business operations. As such, incumbents and fintechs are converging on a digital middle ground.
  <br /><br />
    As this happens, the fintech industry is on the cusp of becoming an integral component of the broader financial services ecosystem. But it will likely first have to go through a complete credit cycle, and survive an economic downturn like the one that set the stage for its arrival in 2008, for this to happen.<sup>2</sup>
