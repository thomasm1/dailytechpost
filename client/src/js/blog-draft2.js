  <p class="firstparagraph">O.K. Google, I'll pass on the lemonade, and ... why don't you take the afternoon off, I'm going to be independent for a while, "again". Alas, we are getting some interesting, if not slightly weird, features from this week's Google I/O 2018 Developer Conference.<sup>1</sup>  So, wonderful news! I'm so tired from picking up my phone to order my take-out, now my Google Assistant can just do all that hard work for me!
  </p><p>This week's revelations from Google's I/0 2018 offer A.I.-focused new hardware features, yet A.I. stole the show. The better integration of Google's assistant <i>with contacts and calling</i> is eyebrow-raising:</p>
  <p class="quote">The demo is part of what Google calls an "experiment" it plans to launch this summer. With Duplex, a "small" number of people will be able to book restaurant reservations and hair appointments and to check holiday hours, stuff you'd normally do over the phone. All of that back and forth happens on the back end -- between Google Assistant and, say, the restaurant. You won't even hear the conversation taking place. It'll come from an unspecified phone number, not your own number.<sup>1</sup></p>
  <p>The feature raises the question of advantage over Siri and Alexa... Although access to the Google-minutiae of our personal information (data thankfully we are now more empowered to download and even delete) begs the question of individuals' machines that talk directly to the restaurant's voice-activated receptionist (perhaps a french accent?) machine. I'm all for efficiency and better organization, but I'd hardly imagine being too busy to place a call myself! 
  </p>
  <p>
  also just mean different assistants for different parts of our day!</p>

  <p class="quote">While GridAgents™ and in general multi-agent systems (MAS) offered strong models for representing complex and dynamic real-world environments, we were missing something very important that is becoming available today with blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. The missing links include (1) consensus, (2) immutability and (3) ability to operate in trustless environments. Dr. Maxim Orlovsky states:

  “Blockchain will give to Multi-Agent AI — the same thing that written language gave to humans — Means of Cognitive Evolution”
  
  Maxim also states that what blockchain brings to multi-agent systems is consensus algorithms for interpreting facts in a trustless multi-agent system. Consensus allows for nodes in the system to be in unanimous agreement on the state of things. Additionally, blockchain creates a permanent memory (immutability) making the vision of multi-agent systems much more complete. I call the addition of blockchain/DLTs to multi-agents system, AI 3.0. This AI 3.0 combines the benefits of over 30 years of research on AI, machine learning, and multi-agent systems with blockchain and DLT technology to finally enable the emerging industry 4.0 where billions of devices will be connected to the internet and will need to coordinate in real-time at the edge of the network.<sup>3</sup> </p>

  <p class="quote">First, blockchain benefits from incumbency and familiarity. Why risk replacing it with a less well-tested technology whose vulnerabilities haven’t all been identified? Also, while it can retain as much transactional data as needed, hashgraph typically doesn’t contain as much transactional history as the Bitcoin blockchain does. For many applications, hashgraph would only keep track of users’ latest positive wallet balances.

  Second, the DAG system doesn’t involve the computation-heavy “proof of work” effort to verify transactions that some blockchains, such as Bitcoin blockchain, require. Having several miners ratify and vote to accept a transaction lends blockchain what some say is a greater degree of security that the ledger contains a single version of the truth than under DAG-based systems. 
  <br />
  <br />
  IOTA, the best-known DAG, is already the No. 10 largest cryptocurrency, with $6.6 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. 
  
  “Even first-year computer science students here at MIT laugh at the code when they see it,” Tadge Dryja, a research scientist at MIT who is working to scale the Bitcoin network, said in an email. 
  
  The hack MIT came up with “can’t happen in practice,” Serguei Popov, one of the founders of IOTA, said in a phone interview.
  
  
Hashgraph uses DAG differently: It uses it to record different aspects of transactions than IOTA, and has different security characteristics, according to hashgraph developers.

  blogpost3 =  `<p class="firstparagraph">The lessons learned from last week's Romaine Lettuce Crisis has brought the <i>supply chain management</i> topic to the nation's dinner-table conversations. 
  (Quick recap in my <a href="#d-18-04-25">April 25th post</a>). The big issue is uninterrupted, comprehensive and permissioned data access to those ... mystery Romaine lettuce heads. What could hashgraph tech offer? Everything from real-time temperature sensors and ID's to cross-institution, cross-border accuracy from source to supply targets. And, next week Congress will also be talking about it:  
  </p>
  <p class="quote">
  Lawmakers in the U.S. Congress are set to hold a hearing on blockchain tech's use in global supply chains next week.

Two subcommittees of the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology - for Research and Technology, and Oversight - will meet on May 8, a newly published notice reveals. The hearing is entitled "Leveraging Blockchain Technology to Improve Supply Chain Management and Combat Counterfeit Goods."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Here, the Science, Space, & Technology Committee <sup>2</sup> of Congress will be meeting This Tuesday, May 8th, hearing from Witnesses from Maersk (head of global trade digitization), UPS (global customs brokerage staff), and of course the good ol' Dept. of Homeland Security, and doubtless a platoon of lawyers! </p>

blogpost2 =  `<p class="firstparagraph">The most polished, cryptographically stable leader of  <i>third generation</i> blockchain technology is formally released this month, and anticipation is anything but calm. (Some background posts help contextualize this 2-part series on Hashgraph  technology and potential for capturing per-micro-second, real-time financial needs of the globalizing economy: <a href="#d-18-04-18"> April 18</a> and <a href="#d-18-04-02">April 2</a>.) The formal release is on May 9th, but this May 1st press release caught my attention as we see a glimpse of this technology on a public* ledger: 
</p>
<p class="quote"> CULedger and Hedera today announced a partnership whereby CULedger will use Hedera's hashgraph platform and public ledger to build a system for cross-border payments. CULedger has already been using the private ledger version of hashgraph, offered by Swirlds, for general purpose, permissioned ledger use.<sup>1</sup> </p>
<p>The big news is Hedera's "public" blockchain ledger service that moves closer to popular usage with it's unique <i>directed acyclic graphs</i>, whose speed increases with scale.  Until recently, Blockchain tech has been hamstrung in the domain of micro-transactions, so now that the barrier has been crossed, how many sectors of life will be enhanced? All. But not yet. Once 5G technology (100 times faster, 100 times the capacity of 4G) is rolled out, then we hit the big leagues.</p> 
<p class="quote">A group of U.S. credit unions looking to pool resources considered the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to track their business, but wound up selecting something else entirely: hashgraph.</p>
<p class="quote">Currently, cross-border payments are painful for all parties involved," said Rick Cranston, COO of CULedger. "They take time, they're expensive, and there is limited visibility into the transaction. Hashgraph is fast and it provides visibility between the two parties at a significantly lower cost. It also eliminates concerns regarding fraud and default, since transactions are recorded immutably on the public ledger, and manual processes, since transactions are automated via smart contracts.<sup>1</sup></p>

blogpost1 =  `<p class="firstparagraph">May. Spring. Exercise. All wonderful things, reacquainting with Nature--if we can and <i>if we let <strong>Tech</strong> let ourselves outside</i>: Let's face it, screens  don't mix well with the sun! <</p>
<p>Recently  though,Tech made a real comeback in the Mother Nature department, thanks to the 2016 Pok&eacute;mon rage that drew crowds out in droves and into the streets and haphazard places over countless miles walked.  Technology, at long last assumes a new role:<i> an ever dedicated activity coach</i> According to <i>Behavioralist psychology</i>, the actions frame the state of mind, so it only makes perfect sense to set our tech devices to where we want to go!</p>
<p>But <i>some</i> of the benefits of exercise ...
</p>
<p class="quote"> 
 Neurotrophins, endogenous proteins that support brain plasticity likely mediate the beneficial effects of exercise on the brain. In clinical studies, exercise increases brain volume in areas implicated in executive processing, improves cognition in children with cerebral palsy and enhances phonemic skill in school children with reading difficulty. Studies examining the intensity of exercise required to optimize neurotrophins suggest that moderation is important. Sustained increases in neurotrophin levels occur with prolonged low intensity exercise, while higher intensity exercise, in a rat model of brain injury, elevates the stress hormone, corticosterone.<sup>1</sup>
