        "post": " \n<p>Doubtless, New Chain Lifecycle is 5% utility, 5% hype and 90% Decentralized App developers' community -- the ingredient <i>par excellence</i> for lasting hype and adoption. Here we have the exponential growth of Ethereum interest, let alone price of token. On the contrary we have Cardano Network, powered by Proof-of-Stake ADA token, which has yet to evolve past TestNet phase, a point of paralysis for Cardano chain DAPP development. One last step before final main net launch, and finally, we can witness David face Goliath...</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\"><i>This year, we are seeing the direct competitors clashing. Ethereum has made great strides to make it scalable and affordable, with the Berlin fork already finalized and London hard fork scheduled for July.\nIn the meantime, Cardano smart contracts should be entering the Cardano testnet by the end of this month.</i><sup>1</sup> \n</p>\n<p>Even if Cardono does launch main net, the multi-year delay in final completion of the the chain --for all its bells and whistles -- has stunted new development and developer solidarity. So why has ADA token reached its All-Time-High of $2.33, with a market cap of 66 billion</p>\n\n",
