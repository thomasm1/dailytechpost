  (Quick recap in my <a href="#d-18-04-25">April 25th post</a>). The big issue is uninterrupted, comprehensive and permissioned data access to those ... mystery Romaine lettuce heads. What could hashgraph tech offer? Everything from real-time temperature sensors and ID's to cross-institution, cross-border accuracy from source to supply targets. And, next week Congress will also be talking about it:

  Lawmakers in the U.S. Congress are set to hold a hearing on blockchain tech's use in global supply chains next week.

Two subcommittees of the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology - for Research and Technology, and Oversight - will meet on May 8, a newly published notice reveals. The hearing is entitled "Leveraging Blockchain Technology to Improve Supply Chain Management and Combat Counterfeit Goods."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Here, the Science, Space, & Technology Committee <sup>2</sup> of Congress will be meeting This Tuesday, May 8th, hearing from Witnesses from Maersk (head of global trade digitization), UPS (global customs brokerage staff), and of course the good ol' Dept. of Homeland Security, and doubtless a platoon of lawyers! </p>

blogpost2 =  `<p class="firstparagraph">The most polished, cryptographically stable leader of  <i>third generation</i> blockchain technology is formally released this month, and anticipation is anything but calm. (Some background posts help contextualize this 2-part series on Hashgraph  technology and potential for capturing per-micro-second, real-time financial needs of the globalizing economy: <a href="#d-18-04-18"> April 18</a> and <a href="#d-18-04-02">April 2</a>.) The formal release is on May 9th, but this May 1st press release caught my attention: 
</p>
<p class="quote"> CULedger and Hedera today announced a partnership whereby CULedger will use Hedera's hashgraph platform and public ledger to build a system for cross-border payments. CULedger has already been using the private ledger version of hashgraph, offered by Swirlds, for general purpose, permissioned ledger use.<sup>1</sup> </p>
<p>The big news is Hedera's "public" blockchain ledger service that moves closer to popular usage with it's unique <i>directed acyclic graphs</i>, whose speed increases with scale.  Until recently, Blockchain tech has been hamstrung in the domain of micro-transactions, so now that the barrier has been crossed, how many sectors of life will be enhanced? All. But not yet. Once 5G technology (100 times faster, 100 times the capacity of 4G) is rolled out, then we hit the big leagues.</p> 
<p class="quote">A group of U.S. credit unions looking to pool resources considered the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to track their business, but wound up selecting something else entirely: hashgraph.</p>
<p class="quote">Currently, cross-border payments are painful for all parties involved," said Rick Cranston, COO of CULedger. "They take time, they're expensive, and there is limited visibility into the transaction. Hashgraph is fast and it provides visibility between the two parties at a significantly lower cost. It also eliminates concerns regarding fraud and default, since transactions are recorded immutably on the public ledger, and manual processes, since transactions are automated via smart contracts.<sup>1</sup></p>

blogpost1 =  `<p class="firstparagraph">May. Spring. Exercise. All wonderful things, reacquainting with Nature--if we can and <i>if we let <strong>Tech</strong> let ourselves outside</i>: Let's face it, screens  don't mix well with the sun! <</p>
<p>Recently  though,Tech made a real comeback in the Mother Nature department, thanks to the 2016 Pok&eacute;mon rage that drew crowds out in droves and into the streets and haphazard places over countless miles walked.  Technology, at long last assumes a new role:<i> an ever dedicated activity coach</i> According to <i>Behavioralist psychology</i>, the actions frame the state of mind, so it only makes perfect sense to set our tech devices to where we want to go!</p>
<p>But <i>some</i> of the benefits of exercise ...
</p>
<p class="quote"> 
 Neurotrophins, endogenous proteins that support brain plasticity likely mediate the beneficial effects of exercise on the brain. In clinical studies, exercise increases brain volume in areas implicated in executive processing, improves cognition in children with cerebral palsy and enhances phonemic skill in school children with reading difficulty. Studies examining the intensity of exercise required to optimize neurotrophins suggest that moderation is important. Sustained increases in neurotrophin levels occur with prolonged low intensity exercise, while higher intensity exercise, in a rat model of brain injury, elevates the stress hormone, corticosterone.<sup>1</sup>
