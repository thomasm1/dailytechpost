<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Why are Sociologists now the New Rulers over Data Analysis within the Domain of Blockchain Technologies?</h6> 



<p class="firstparagraph">Firstly, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology (peer-to-peer global ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate, individual needs and uses. These blockchain "network" analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network changes, node changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly or not. Therefore, blockchain technologies must accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships) that include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Further, analysis challenges arise from informal practices<sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate for the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>



<p> Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan's (1977) <i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple <i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time, convenience, etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm human understanding <i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of a bank, a person, or a company's internal bot?  The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought the world the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can only contribute little on how to interface with social needs. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the multi-dimensional layers of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks? Well enough to differentiate qualitative meaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.  



</p> 

<p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved, integrated through multiple layers of "middlemen", such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions, non-governmental, non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases the middlemen.  Suddenly, one programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team of hospital employees spent a month writing, then their careers overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing. The crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the life of the contract.  Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years' Sociology Network Analysts' research and analytical development.  Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and should not turn to the Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already at home, safe within the academic domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology can either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances, accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises. Or, the next ten years can follow Sociology's Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful future. </p> 

<p>



Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on review of the Sociologists' specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships, within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships. We Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized by fixed patterns. No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes that characterize societal behavior.  Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large Number Statistical Theory become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900's Sociological French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach's work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society's Collective Memory.</p> 

<p>

No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic's "irrational behaviors" and Mathematical "complexity models" do not <i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate simultaneous node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups get jobs), and most importantly the <i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time and fixed. </p> 

<p>Fine. So, why is Sociology's network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th and 20th centuries' network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era, while </strong>   North American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960's [post-1968], U.S. in the 1990's[post-1999], in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of past sociology are inherently small-data and more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates "human-ness" into the billion rows and columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p> 

<p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of each relationship (link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is possible to isolate directional, conditional <i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation<sup id="9one">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on social networks. </p> 

<p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person <i>self-selects</i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group's behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group's behavior, by the group's influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder's SIENA software, achieves the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology. The network graph can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes (social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount of missing data</p> 

<p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear, directed path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists are called upon, blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again the same bugs. Sadly, this semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain for their currency, contract, and other societal needs--in this case, the blind will indeed lead the blind.   </p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">How Can We Best Modularize our App Designs in Order to Achieve the Much Vaunted "Separation of Concerns"?</h6> 



<p class="firstparagraph">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed Order of Coders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from structural design. Hence, in the early 2000's, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to abide by The scaffolding of HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we must throw out this antiquated division of labor within web coding.  </p> <p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules and components Must hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled html, js, css, it is now requisite to divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and<i> each</i> of these component teams <strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module's required html, js, css.  </p><p>

This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and all coding will necessarily begin to 'reinvent the wheel.' This is because any module, any library you go to, will <i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate new css from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual misery, almost instantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p><p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then?  It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher level of abstraction, leaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice in the modern world, and if ad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity? If yesterday's craft was the hoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part by part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and pastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module definition? That's absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules. The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an age that each year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic sugar and also fundamental structure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. </p><p>Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us to a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the "Separation of Concerns."  We can allow ourselves a break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must <i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create! </p>

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">About the Facebook Scandal, Mark Zuckerberg is innocent</h6> 



<p class="firstparagraph">Facebook Scandals<sup>1</sup> of recent months have demoralized the leadership for a role of misinformation in the Tech Age, however I charge Mark Zuckerberg's innocence <i>not</i> because all of us, as a society, were equally warned. Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created abnormal, never-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were so efficient at multiplying and exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social learning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own control.</p>

 <p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial <sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation were not entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural changes from higher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in their content and influence) begin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes dominated by the relationships, e.g., the "likes" and "shares", leading to a statistically natural propensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel to the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal and tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary <i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p><p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual "interruptions" that previously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains:  </p>

 <p class="quote">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication that the timespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation Bias, misinformation and outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that are already hard to change.  </p><p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned, <i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network phenomonenon--ultimately driven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry, conditional influences, and the strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these factors, our social inclinations were <i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were! </p><p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network phenomena -- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!

<p class="firstparagraph">Other than college pre-med students, few know the MCAT exam--the gatekeeper of U.S. &amp; Canadian Medical Schools--underwent a major modification in 2015<sup>2</sup>. Much deeper than Biological and Technological updates, major sections were added and/or expanded including the Social, Pyschological and Biological foundations of <i>behavior</i>. Named the <i>Health Systems Science</i><sup>3</sup>, the American Medical Association's modern,  holistic approach articulates outcomes-based measures for healthy living and disease prevention efforts. You could say the AMA is indeed, <i>woke</i>. </p><p>But really, what's the difference and why would we care? And, who doesn't know that an apple-a-day keeps the doctor away? Dr. Jeffrey Borkan, MD, PHD of Brown University's Warren Alpert Medical School, explains the evident role of all those unnoticed  social interactions involved in obtaining and consuming that apple. Further, the spatial and economic <i>availability</i> of that apple also plays a role in keeping the doctor away. Borkan explains:

</p><p class="quote">It's time for us to take a leap forward in educating physicians for the health care delivery models of the future—those that aim to improve not just the health of the individual patient and their family, but also the community and the population<sup>4</sup>. 

</p><p>What, then, specifically, are the mechanisms that a community network's aggregated health may be inextricably tied up with <i>our own</i> individual health? 

    In short, they are the sharing of health-promoting resources, timely assistance, health-promoting information channels -- all this, among the countless perks of a healthy social circle!

<h6 class="chapternumber">

Feb 14, 2018</h6> 

<p class="firstparagraph">Given the tragic events at a Florida school over Valentine's Day, 2018, who can write about Fitbits? So, thoughts and sympathy for those students today that endured this horror.   19 years after the first-of-its-kind school shooting, we as an American society have not become 'numb' to these events. It hurts as much as it did in 1999.</p

><p> Darn that innocuous Spring day in 1999, when we heard the most absurd news--

students attacked their own colleagues at Colombine? In my blog post from January 10, I wrote that American Sociology, along with Qu&eacute;bec, came of age much later than European Sociology. The past 50 years' social changes and new problems are generally atrributed for the increasing demand for sociological expertise after 1999, after a singular, senseless tragedy of a school shooting--this event, like a small kernel of societal desperation for a solution--led to a flurry of self-professed sociologists &agrave; la Michael Moore's Colombine, and other  social-responsibility themed social consciousness. So far, only mutually incompatible solutions.

The problem, however, is not new, only the manifestation of it.</p><p>Suicide rates in 19th century France, disproportionately high, also served as a symptomatic manifestation of the same problem, called <i>Anomie.</i><sup>1</sup> The term, <i>Anomie</i>, coined by Emile Durkheim in the late 1800's, captured the sense of instability, cultural and moral relativism that undermined a shared sense of meaning.

Suicides, week-after-week, month-after-month? In 1897 France, noone had ever seen it before--at such rates--and people wanted answers. Alas, a kernel of social desperation leading to inquiry.</p><p> 

People wanted to know why so many in the population responded negatively to the rapid changes, urbanization (Dreadful factory conditions &agrave; la <i>Taylorism's</i> calculated efficiency) new technologies, i.e. electricity, railroads, steam engines;

these created an arbitrarily new world, very suddenly. Suddenly, like trying for the first time a roller-coaster, when all you've ever known has been the carousel. So, we see technology's role for well or for ill, our job is to understand how to dial-in the tech specs necessary to keep society smiling on this roller coaster through another, yet not altogether new, technological thrill-ride.

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Blockchains, Bitcoins and The Unnecessary Risk of Shopping at Target with a Credit Card</h6>  


<p class="firstparagraph">Has anyone else been underwhelmed by the lack of Bitcoin's daily <i>presence</i>, despite its everpresence at the dinner tables and caf&eacute;s across America. Sure, it's more of a "metropolitan" phenomenon; and sure, it's become an accepted global platform--along with myriad other crypto-currencies, but it's exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies are useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency's rise to fame with last year's  increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its contributions, uses, fame are one-sidedly <i>macro-</i>economic.  A recent CNET article<sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of <i>actual</i> use at the "cash-registers" of society.</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological <i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Roger's Diffusion of Innovations<sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger's bell curve ranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However, the blockchain articles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine usefulness for the every-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>

<p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is <i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific information--whether financial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order before I continue, since we can all relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most notably concerning Target store credit card hacks a couple years ago. </p><p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions, this person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction: they prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that $27, $200, or $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their <i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and if the store's databases are hacked, then tough-luck! </p><p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for each transaction, providing the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient! Nobody thinks to walk around with their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit card system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions have had to rely on the many layers of security, passwords, pins, mothers' maiden names, etc. Then, based on the mathematics behind prime numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright red target on it. </p><p>Now, the crypto-contract  provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And that, my friends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency, instead the crypto-<i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero's name is the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide pinpointed, <i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for the sake of renting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don't need this. They need to know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire governmental database of information about you!

<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle"> Tech on the Regret: Unintended, secondary effects of communication- and activity-based app-designs </h6> 






<p class="firstparagraph" >Given that our app-use is inextricably tied up with our own    behavior, activity/communication-based app developers have in the past year accepted (mostly in word) a renewed responsibility.  More like resposibility for a multi-faceted power of influence granted to an industry, suddenly, disproportionately great, and <i>semi-arbitrarily related</i> to the designer's intent (and control!). After all, if the Saintly Mark Zuckerberg's activity/communication-based app inadvertantly led to novel, and deeply consequential, effects, then anyone could. </p><p>After all, who could guess <i>how</i> these app-design effects would affect the users, years later. Who do we think programmers are, sociologists?  More specifically, who could know <i>which</i> mundane coding practices, arbitrary app-design--like sharing permissions/features? Sure, everyone deep down knew  their company practices yield unfathomable power of influence over the daily habits of cell-users, a.k.a. everyone. The easy part is knowing; the hard part is learning how and why certain app-features lead to behavioral risks.</p><p>There could be no better example than the Alcoholic faced with an intervention by a loving family longing for change. The alcoholic could be forgiven for past misdeeds, but without actual <i>Acknowledgement</i> of a crisis in direction, which necessitates professional help from social scientists. Therefore, the recent <i>acknowledgments</i> signify something deeper--they signify a humility that app-designers are not sociologists, generally speaking. So, that means hiring sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists for every N<small>th</small> app-coder and software engineer. History can't be rewritten, but it can be interpreted and learned from. The acknowledgment is itself a victory if it induces learning from the raw, social sciences, whose expertise <i>can</i> predict how or why certain "life"-features,  practices, and policies often unfold with undue and unintended social consequences.  </p>



<p>Water under the bridge, but going forward, it is one thing to claim a "renewed sense of remorse", another to acknowledge, learn and change. Like last November<sup>1</sup> when Facebook co-founder Sean Parker confessed certain designs like "social-validation feedback loop" and other app-design intentions, while ignoring potential secondary effects on society. So, the <i>Acknowledgment</i> is the big win here--not so much the remorse!

<small>Tech   jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! However, I felt a technical &amp; contextualizing addition to my February 15th blog on the micro-economic horizon of blockchain technologies. </small></h6><br />
<p class="firstparagraph" >7
 Ethereum-based technological features  offer us a new world -- a decentralized new world, not dependent on the centralized servers of Instagram, Comcast, T-Mobile, Amazon, etc. With that statement ends general consensus among blockchain experts, pundits, and authors. However, if the current logistical obstacles provide controversy and competing algorithms over sustainability, security, and scalability, then they reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses (and potential effects) than they hide. In my February 15th <a href="#18-02-15">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects of the crypto-contract horizon.</p>

<p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the <i>productivity</i> of our work  as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals? First, a little background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum blockchain helps distinguish itself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech, like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based blockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers  a syntax  and programming features, e.g. "looping", "recursion",   with the full power of a <i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable problem. </p>

<p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the accounting system of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction, An Ethereum blockchain transaction would resemble a  network of computers, <i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine.  This allows for Quickbooks to calculate into a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program.  Much more useful!</p>

<p>Therefore, Ethereum's Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum blockchain is actually a "Virtual Machine", like a a big networked "home computer". The native language of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an <i>application binary interface</i>, ABI.  So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home computer, then directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman's terms, the manner that modern-day app, for example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one programming system to interact with another, such as Instragram offers a "sharing API" that connects to hardware contacts, thus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook account, via your T-Mobile phone's contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we live in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system, which exchanges API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier.  </p>

<p>So, are we out of the woods?  Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity days; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise. The reason being that digital math uses binary "on/off" calculations, while quantum math implicates a tertiary,<i>qubit</i> "simultaneous states". Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology, both programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA's blockchain design utilizes a <i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one's transaction is entered into with a private-key, and the blockchain moreso resembles a "Tangle" of a directed graph, which allows for computational "states".  IOTA recently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent vulnerability. In truth, this was a case of user-error because users were <i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer could crack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough now to cause damage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum possibilities.

<p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Social useablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun to emerge, at least in form, with little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd generation Patrician directed graph blockchain.  The underlying principle of the blockchain's micro-economic utiliity through crypto-<i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions for Supply &amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of the Hard Sciences of Mathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics ... ;-)  <br />... to be continued ...

<br />Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute; la Western Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. Remittances--like if I wire a $2 Loonie coin to a Canadian friend's Canadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national payments systems, thus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut. Like everything else--c'est la vie. Or is it? The beauty of Ethereum is that it "talks" well with others and across borders, while Bitcoin is muzzled in these situations that involve even semi-basic calculations. However, </p>
